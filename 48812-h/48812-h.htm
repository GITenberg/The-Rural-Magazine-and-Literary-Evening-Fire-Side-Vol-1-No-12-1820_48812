<p>In my last number I availed myself
of the occasion, to dwell with some
emphasis, on the necessity and advantage
of retrospection. The past is
rife with lessons of experience, fitted
to serve as waymarks and beacons,
for the government of human conduct
in the subsequent course. Obvious
as this may appear, it is nevertheless
lamentably true, as the venerable
<span class="smcap">John Adams</span> has somewhere
observed, that our attention is too frequently
monopolized in the pursuit of
present enjoyment, and that each succeeding
generation is not satisfied,
until it "<em>has made experience for itself</em>."
It is, however, gratifying to
believe, that many are not so unmindful
of their real interests, and so destitute
of true wisdom; but are on
proper occasions employed, in "looking
before and after." To these no
apology will be necessary, for recommending
a preparation for those duties,
which appertain to the severe
and dreary season, upon which we are
now entering. A season, above all
others calculated, to illustrate the generous
and benevolent principles of
our nature; and which calls most
loudly and authoritatively for their exercise.
When indigence is gifted
with peculiar eloquence, which the
powers of a <span class="smcap">Burke</span> or an <span class="smcap">Ames</span>, could
scarcely <em>heighten</em>. We are fortunately
so constituted, that the sight of distress
is amply sufficient to awaken our
sympathy, without requiring by a
conclusive moral deduction, the establishment
of the fact, that it is our
duty to sympathize with the objects
of it. Ere long a wide field will present
itself for mitigating the sufferings
and relieving the wants of</p>

<p class="center">
THE POOR.<br />
</p>

<p>The most efficacious <em>preventive</em>,
of the evils attendant on poverty, is
the general and extensive application
of mental and moral discipline to the
rising generation. This is the only
radical remedy for the disease; a
truth, which should never be lost
sight of, by forecasting statesmen and
enlightened philanthropists. But the
urgency and immediate pressure of
want, requires prompt relief, not to
be derived from this source. The
array of indigence will be unusually
great during the approaching winter,
for even honest industry is frequently
disappointed in its search after
employment. Among the objects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
of public beneficence there will generally
be found a considerable number
of this description, whose condition
is the result of misfortune alone;
while the calamities of others, are
the consequences of vice and improvidence.
But it should always be remembered,
that wretchedness and
misery from whatever cause they
may proceed, are entitled to commiseration;
and that genuine charity imitates
though at infinite distance, the
example of our beneficent Creator,
who "maketh his sun to rise on
the evil and on the good, and sendeth
rain on the just and on the unjust."</p>

<p>The most salutary mode of extending
relief, is unquestionably that of
employment. Idleness is uniformly
prejudicial to sound morals, and intrinsically
mischievous in its character.
When alms are distributed it
is moreover, far preferable to furnish
the necessaries of life, rather than
money, which is too often misapplied.
As this is to many, the season
of plenty and good cheer, particularly
in the country, the situation of the
necessitous is from this circumstance,
entitled to primary consideration. I
well remember, when a boy and residing
in a neighbouring county, being
despatched to some of the poor
in the vicinity, with a part of the superabundance
of the season; and
their grateful and affectionate benedictions
on the head of their revered
benefactor, will never be forgotten.
I may perhaps be indulged in adding,
that I rejoice in believing, that he is
now in that city "which hath foundations;"
not one of whose inhabitants
can say "I am sick." The example
of such men is cheering and
of signal advantage to society. "The
memory of the just is blessed."</p>

<p>I am well aware, that to dwell at
length on the subject here recommended,
would, as it respects some
of the patrons of the Rural Magazine
be an act of supererogation. To such
as these, all that is necessary to stimulate
to a performance of their duties
to their unfortunate fellow creatures,
is to be made acquainted with their
situation. The extension of the necessary
assistance, is however, in many
instances, a task of peculiar delicacy.
Reference is here made to
those who have seen happier days,
and whose feelings, will not permit
them publicly to solicit relief. In
this class will generally be found, the
least obtrusive but most deserving individuals;
those who have undoubted
claims on the generous and humane.</p>

<p>As this is probably the last opportunity,
I shall have of holding communion,
with my readers, it would be
a source of real satisfaction, should
ever a solitary hint of a profitable tendency,
be derived from this valedictory
paper. If the pressure of grief
and privation, in a single instance be
obviated, the reward would indeed be
ample. Duties of the most imperative
and important character, are constantly
claiming our serious and assiduous
attention. I cannot therefore,
with more propriety, terminate my
humble, desultory labours, than by
sincerely and fervently desiring, that
when the winter of old age and the
evening of life shall arrive, we may
enjoy the delightful consciousness of
having faithfully performed our respective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
obligations, and particularly
those which we owe to <small>THE POOR</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<big><strong>☞</strong></big></p>

<h2>THE VILLAGE TEACHER.</h2>


<p>The winter season of desolation as
it is, has charms and attractions of
its own. There is something exquisitely
mournful in the whistling of its
winds through the leafless branches
of the forest, and around the lonely
walls of a country dwelling. The absence
of all gaudy decoration and its
mute and desert loneliness give to
the landscape a sublimity which is in
perfect keeping with these deeper
and harsher tones of the lyre of Æolus.
The mind that has been at all
trained in the school of nature, and
has drank of true philosophy at its
source amid fields and groves and
mountains, can catch the glow of inspiration
even from these stern and
rugged features. It can discern in
every aspect of external nature a
feeling and an attribute, touching and
peculiar, and can trace out in them
those moral truths, of which it would
seem that the forms of the physical
creation, are but the types and the
shadows. It is not merely that the
remembrance of the enjoyments and
hopes which have faded, and of the
friends that are no more, subdue and
chasten the soul; but the naked majesty,
and austere colouring of the
landscape find an answer in the mind.
We view life divested of its gaudy
trappings, and feel the cold reality of
what had mocked us at a distance with
the semblance of felicity. At the same
time the hopes which endure, and the
happiness which we know by experience
to be solid, gain value in our estimation,
as we are thus lifted above
a dependence upon transitory and perishing
enjoyments.</p>

<p>I had by this train of thought,
wrought up my mind to a comfortably
good opinion of my own fortitude,
during a long ramble to-day, and was
seated by my solitary fire this evening,
meditating on the subject I had chosen
for my next essay, and heaping
Pelion upon Ossa in my dreams of future
eminence; when a letter from
the Editors was brought in, announcing
that the next number of the Magazine
was to be the last.</p>

<p>The angels in Milton's Pandemonium
did not more suddenly contract
into pigmies than did my fancied self-importance
at this sad intelligence.
From the port and aspect of one of
the enlighteners of mankind, I shrunk
at once into an obscure village schoolmaster
unknown beyond the next
township, and unnoticed save by a few
of my humble patrons,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Husbanding that which I possess within<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And going to the grave unthought of."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I looked round in my despair upon
the naked walls, and they seemed to
stare at me, as even they had never
heard of me. An impertinent cricket
in the wainscot was the only audible
being near me and he kept on with
his idle song, as if in derision. The
feeling of disappointment for a time
overpowered my philosophy, and I
did not see my gorgeous hopes vanish
into air without a bitter feeling of regret.
To be thus cut off in the very
bud of expectancy of authorship&mdash;to
have that genial current of thought
and feeling which was but beginning
to flow turned back to its source, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
misfortunes which none but an author
can estimate, and which send us back
to the dull routine of life with altered
feelings.</p>

<p>Why should I not please myself
with the imagination of what I might
have achieved? It is true that of the
many into whose hands these numbers
have fallen, the greater part may
have passed over my essays unnoticed.</p>

<p>An inharmonious period&mdash;an uninteresting
sentiment may have caught
their attention, and they have turned
away with indifference. Of those who
have perused them, many have done
it in a spirit of captious criticism, some
with forced and struggling attention,
and a few perhaps with real kindness
and interest. Yet all this ill will and
kindness and indifference has been lost
upon me, and disturb not the dreams
of vanity. The stillness of my retreat
has not been broken by a sound of
murmur or approbation, nor do I
know that I have lightened for a moment
the brow of sorrow, or attracted
for a still shorter period, the attention
of the busy, or the idle:&mdash;happy
if from this failure also, I
shall learn another lesson of humility
and shrink without repining into my
own proper dimensions.</p>

<p>I have not entered my first and
fortieth year without being armed
against such disappointments, nor
will I part from them with whom I
have thus sojourned in ill will or moroseness.
What, though I may have
overrated my own powers of entertainment,
I have only proclaimed that
which is the open or secret vanity of
all. What though my readers have
gone unsatisfied away from the table
which I had spread for them?&mdash;the
fruits of wisdom though harsh and
austere in their taste, have not lost
their savour with <em>me</em>; they still hang
upon the tree of nature, and I can yet
gather them for my own sustenance,
though it be in solitude and obscurity.
Minds, to whose gigantic proportions
I feel myself a pigmy have
exhausted their skill in portraying
the beauty of virtue, and the world
still lingers in corruption and defilement.
My own efforts would have
been more important, and I begin to
think that I should have wasted my
strength in idle display; if indeed I
had not met with rueful discomfiture.</p>

<p>Reader! if in thy journeyings
through the heart of Pennsylvania
thou shouldst pass the quiet hamlet
of Plainfield&mdash;if the recollection of
these essays still linger in thy heart
and thou shouldst seek a further acquaintance
with their author&mdash;stop,
and inquire at my landlord's for</p>

<h2>EXCURSION FROM EDINBURGH TO
DUBLIN.</h2>

<p class="center">BY AN AMERICAN.</p>


<p class="sig">
<i>Glasgow, Friday, April 11, 1817.</i><br />
</p>

<p>At the hour of dinner we went to
'North wood-side,' a delightful country
residence about two miles from
Glasgow, the property of an opulent
merchant. It is situated upon the
Kelvin, a tributary stream of the
Clyde, and together with its grounds,
exhibits striking evidences of the elegant
but costly taste of its proprietor.
The gentleman has been in America,
and was not a little attached to its form
of government,&mdash;a partiality which
naturally extended itself to the individuals
concerned in its administration;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
and, accordingly we were gratified
with beholding the portraits of
several of our most distinguished
countrymen adorning the walls of his
apartments. The afternoon passed
highly to our satisfaction; and we
would gladly have accepted an invitation,
which was given with a sincerity
which could not be mistaken,
to protract our visit beyond the day,
but for engagements which required
our return to Glasgow. After coffee
we left North Wood-side, and reached
the city in season to sup at the Rev.
Dr. Chalmers'.</p>

<p>It had been my good fortune to
meet and become partially acquainted
with this extraordinary man in
Edinburgh. He has politely invited
me to visit him in Glasgow, and this
morning I called at his house, and
passed half an hour with him. I
found him then much engaged in
completing some preparations for a
journey to London which he is to
commence on Monday. He desired
my company at supper in the evening,
and extended the invitation to
my companion. We found a few
friends at his house, among whom
were several ladies. Mrs. C. possesses
a pleasing person, and engaging
manners, and performed the honours
of the table with great propriety.
Dr. C. had finished the necessary arrangements
for his journey, and entered
freely into an animated and instructive
conversation. His colloquial
powers are of a high order.
Even in familiar conversation, he is
impressive and striking;&mdash;although
he seems not to be ambitious of display
or the distinction of taking a
lead.&mdash;He is at home on most of the
popular topics of the day. In discussing
any of interest, he engages
'<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">totus in illis</i>.' His thoughts in that
case are rapid, and his remarks,&mdash;assuming
the complexion of his fervid
mind,&mdash;abound in glowing but easy
illustrations. He spoke very feelingly
upon the subject of the English
poor laws, and the alarming increase
of mendicity in Scotland. As in instance
of the unnatural state of things
in Glasgow itself, he referred to the
sum of 14,000<i>l.</i> sterling, which in
less than a month had been raised by
subscription in this single city, for the
relief of the poorer classes. To the
honour, however, of the wealthy population
of Glasgow, it should be
added, that the moneys thus contributed,
have been more than enough,
with other private benefactions, to
supply the present need; and the
surplus has been funded to meet
some future, and I hope, very distant
exigency.</p>

<p>Conversation at table turned upon
that dark and malignant spirit of infidelity,
which under various forms,
seems insidiously stealing like a pestilence
throughout society. Dr. C's.
remarks upon this subject were very
eloquent, both in commenting upon
the different masks which it assumes,
and the coverts wherein it lurks, and
in suggesting some seemingly effectual
checks to the prevalence of this
tremendous evil. The inquiries of
Dr. C. relative to America, as well
now as during a former interview,
indicated no small degree of attention
which he has paid to its civil and
religious institutions. He spoke in
terms of great commendation of the
writings of the late Jonathan Edwards,
and pronounced them to be among
the ablest in English theology. In
metaphysics he considers Edwards
to have equalled the deepest thinkers
of his age.</p>

<p>The supper at Dr. C's. was liberally
and tastfully provided. Immediately
after its removal, and before
the wine was placed upon the table,
the service of evening devotion was
introduced. It was simple but engaging;
consisting of a portion of
scripture, which was read with great
solemnity, and a prayer, during which
all the company kneeled, as is usual
to family devotions throughout this
country. The servants were present.
It was nearly twelve o'clock when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
took leave of Dr. C. A very friendly
request which he made that I would
visit him hereafter in Glasgow, I fear
that I shall never have it in my power
to comply with.</p>

<p><i>Glasgow, 14th April.</i>&mdash;Yesterday
I had the satisfaction to hear Dr.
Chalmers preach once more. It was
generally understood that it would
be the last time that he would officiate
in Glasgow for two or three
months, and the crowds which assembled
to hear him were very great.
He was absent from his own pulpit,
by exchange, in the morning, which
did not prevent, however many from
following him to the church where
he preached. The Tron, in the afternoon,
was overflowing some time
before the hour of service, and the
rush of people to the doors was as
great as I have seen at Covent Garden,
when John Kemble was to play.
I repaired early to the church with
some ladies, and we were fortunate
in procuring excellent seats. Dr. C.
fully equalled my expectations, although
I have heard him in Edinburgh
produce a superior effect.
The eloquence of this great man is
very vehement and impassioned. The
effect which he produces in preaching,
does not consist in approaching
his point by any artful and covert
process of reasoning and illustration,
but by openly marching up and confronting
it with unhesitating and manly
intrepidity. Whatever faults may
be detected in Dr. C's. style by the
cool eye of fastidious criticism,&mdash;from
the profusion of his ornaments,
the overstraining of his metaphors,
the redundancy of his expression,&mdash;perhaps
there is no person living who,
when once seen and heard, would be
pronounced more free from the petty
or laboured artifices which are generally
employed to recommend and enforce
instruction. So regardless is
he of the factitious aids of composition,
that his style may often be considered
negligent, and sometimes
even coarse. This again may be regarded
by hyper-critics as a species
of affectation; a contrary, and, I believe,
a juster inference may be drawn
from the fact. Dr. C. unconsciously
overlooks, while he is thought studiously
to disdain, the more common
trappings and gilding of composition.
In preaching, he seems wholly absorbed
in his sublime occupation, and
to be irresistibly borne along by the
grandeur of his theme. As a man,
he appears to sink under a prostrating
sense of his own personal nothingness,
but as a herald of the
Christian faith, he rises to the majesty
of more than mortal elevation. In
discussing the great truths of Revelation,
his imagination kindles; and
strange it would be if it did not. The
fire which is elicited is the natural
effect of the rapid motion of his
thoughts, combined with the fervour
of his ardent piety. His single services
yesterday were enough to prove
him the first preacher of his age. In
each of his discourses there are some
parts which are particularly impassioned,
and at such moments he hurries
onward as with the excitement of
inspiration, and produces an effect
which Whitefield could not have surpassed.
At these times, too, the listening
audience may be seen bending
forward, as if with breathless interest,
to catch each word as it falls from his
lips; and, on his arriving at the conclusion
of the particular train of sentiment,
again arousing as from the spell
of a dream to the reality of conscious
existence. This is not fancy, or if it
be, it is one which I am not singular
in possessing. Dr. C. at least produces
the effect of awakening susceptibilities
in the most obdurate bosoms.
I was present one evening
when he was preaching in lady Glenorchy's
chapel, in Edinburgh, and
occupied a seat next to Spurzheim,
the celebrated craniologist. I noticed
that he was deeply engaged by
the preacher. On his finishing, I inquired
what he thought of him? "It
is too much, too much," said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
passing his hand across his forehead,
"my brain is on a fever by what I
have been hearing," a striking declaration
from a cold and phlegmatic
German.</p>

<p>Dr. C. seems to act and feel as one,
who, possessed of great intellectual
endowments, is conscious that he
owes them all to the service of religion.
His aim apparently is, to "bring
every thought into captivity to the
truth of Christ," and to "cast down
each lofty imagination," at the foot
of the cross. To add to the weight
of his discourses, he is accustomed to
call into requisition the abounding
stores of his various knowledge. In
delivering his sermons he usually
commences in a low, but always a
distinct tone of voice; and proceeds
for some time with a calm and uniform
utterance. As his subject is
developed, his mind and feelings gradually
expand, and his voice is insensibly
raised. His manner at first is
not prepossessing; nor indeed is his
voice to an English ear, as it has
much of the Fifeshire accent. The
hearer, however, soon loses whatever
is disagreeable in each; and even forgets
the man while listening to the
message of the preacher. Dr. C.
appears turned of thirty-eight, in his
person he is tall, and rather slender;
his hair and complexion incline
to dark; his eye is a blue tending
to gray, and is distinguished at first
only by a certain heaviness in its expression.
It beams however in conversation,
and flashes in public discourse.</p>

<p>Some facts in the history of this
extraordinary man are peculiar. For
the first few years of his ministry he
was settled in Kilmany, an inconsiderable
parish in the county of Fife.
While there, he was generally accounted
a man of talents, but rather
indifferent to the duties of his profession,
fond of social and gay company,
proud of his intellectual powers
no less so of his acquirements,
and careless of the construction which
the more serious part of the community
might put upon his principles
and sentiments. If I am correctly informed,
he occasionly gave lectures
in natural philosophy at the university
of St. Andrews, and was considered
as belonging to the moderate party
in the kirk. Dr. Brewster applied
to him to write the article <i>Christianity</i>,
in his Encyclopedia; and it is
said, that the train of thought into
which his investigation led him, terminated
in convictions which had the
effect of changing his whole course
of life and sentiments; and from
that moment, entering into the ranks
of orthodoxy, he became an eminent
and powerful champion of the
faith. His essay has since been published
in a separate form, and entitled
the "Evidences of Christianity."
Shortly after this remarkable change,
his reputation rose with astonishing
rapidity; his zeal in the service of
religion became inextinguishable;
and if the excellence of a preacher
is to be estimated by his popularity,
Dr. C. is decidedly the first in Great
Britain. He was transferred to Glasgow
two or three years ago. His
parish is very large, consisting, as he
told me, of nearly ten thousand souls.
So great a number imposes duties
upon him peculiarly heavy: nor does
his constitution seem capable of sustaining
his fatigues. In delivering
his discourses from the pulpit, which
generally occupy an hour, it is usual
with him to stop about midway, and
read a hymn of six or eight verses,
to be sung by the audience, while an
opportunity is given him to recover
from the partial exhaustion occasioned
by this vehement oratory. The
people in Edinburgh are desirous of
erecting a church for him, and requesting
him to settle among them;
but an obstacle is found in the jealousy
of the inhabitants of Glasgow,
who look with no small uneasiness
upon every thing which tends to
aggrandize the reputation of Edinburgh.</p>

<h2>THE NATURAL HISTORY OF ANTS.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h2>


<p>Natural history is perhaps the most
amusing of studies, though not so
useful as botany or chemistry. It is
curious to observe, however, on the
score of utility, that the more minute
parts of creation are of infinitely
greater importance than the superior
creatures in the scale of animal life.
A knowledge of entomology is calculated
to elicit more for the benefit
of man, than an acquaintance with
the habits of the larger brutes: the
bee, the silk-worm, the cochineal insect,
the Spanish fly, &amp;c. &amp;c. are far
more essential to our purposes than the
lion, the elephant, the rhinoceros, or
the bear; even the sheep and the
cow, only compete with these insects,
as clothiers and victuallers; and the
horse is merely physical force, subjected
to the direction of the higher
animal, man.</p>

<p>If we consider further, how very
limited our research has yet been
into the micrographick world, we
may, without being thought too speculative,
lose ourselves in the idea of
the immensity of stores that remain
to be discovered in the merest particles
of animated nature: there is nothing
too much to be imagined on the
subject. But our business is rather
to disclose the remarkable circumstances
ascertained by the ingenious
M. Huber, than to indulge in theorising;
and we therefore proceed to
his History of Ants, which we have
found so entertaining, that we have no
doubt it will furnish more than one
interesting paper for our work.</p>

<p>The first chapter treats of the architecture
of ants. The various habits
of these wonderful insects are
amply described; and were we not
assured by ocular examination, of
the truth of many of the particulars,
we could hardly extend our belief to
the prodigies related by the author:
but we have witnessed so much that
we can credit all. To return to the
architecture; we find that their habitations,
their cities, are not the least
curious of their performances. Mr.
Huber details the formation of a domicile
by the fallow ants, and adds&mdash;</p>

<p>"Our little insects, now in safety
in their nest, retire gradually to the
interior before the last passages are
closed, one or two only remain without,
or concealed behind the doors on
guard, whilst the rest either take
their repose, or engage in different
occupations in the most perfect security.</p>

<p>"I was impatient to know what
took place in the morning upon these
ant-hills, and therefore visited them
at an early hour. I found them in
the same state in which I had left
them the preceding evening. A
few ants were wandering about on the
surface of the nest, some others issued
from time to time from under
the margin of the little roofs formed
at the entrance of the galleries: others
afterwards came forth who began removing
the wooden bars that blockaded
the entrance, in which they
readily succeeded. This labour occupied
them several hours. The passages
were at length free, and the
materials with which they had been
closed scattered here and there over
the ant-hill.</p>

<p>"Every day, morning and evening,
during the fine weather, I was a witness
to similar proceedings. On
days of rain, the doors of all the ant-hills
remain closed. When the sky
is cloudy in the morning, or rain is
indicated, the ants who seem to be
aware of it, open but in part their
several avenues, and immediately
close them when the rain commences.
It would appear from this they are
not insensible of the motive for which
they form these temporary closures.</p>

<p>"To have an idea how the straw or
stubble roof is formed, let us take a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
view of the ant-hill at its origin, when
it is simply a cavity in the earth.
Some of its future inhabitants are
seen wandering about in search of
materials fit for the exterior work,
with which, though rather irregularly,
they cover up the entrance; whilst
others are employed in mixing the
earth, thrown up in hollowing the interior,
with fragments of wood and
leaves, which are every moment
brought in by their fellow-assistants;
and this gives a certain consistence
to the edifice, which increases in size
daily. Our little architects leave
here and there cavities, where they
intend constructing the galleries which
are to lead to the exterior; and as
they remove in the morning the barriers
placed at the entrance of their
nest the preceding evening, the passages
are kept entire during the
whole time of its construction. We
soon observe it to become convex;
but we should be greatly deceived
did we consider it solid. This roof
is destined to include many apartments
or stories. Having observed
the motions of these little masons
through a pane of glass which I adjusted
against one of their habitations,
I am enabled to speak with some degree
of certainty upon the manner in
which they are constructed."</p>

<p>"I never found, even after long
and violent rains, the interior of the
nest wetted to more than a quarter
of an inch from the surface, provided
it had not been previously out of repair,
or deserted by its inhabitants."</p>

<p>"The ants are extremely well
sheltered in their chambers, the
largest of which is placed nearly in
the centre of the building; it is much
loftier than the rest, and traversed
only by the beams that support the
ceiling: it is in this spot that all the
galleries terminate, and this forms,
for the most part, their usual residence."</p>

<p>"Those ants who lay the foundation
of a wall, a chamber, or gallery,
from working separately, occasion
now and then a want of coincidence
in the parts of the same or different
objects. Such examples are of no
unfrequent occurrence, but they by
no means embarrass them. What
follows proves that the workman on
discovering his error, knew how to
rectify it.</p>

<p>"A wall had been erected with
the view of sustaining a vaulted ceiling,
still incomplete, that had been
projected from the wall of the opposite
chamber. The workman who
began constructing it, had given it too
little elevation to meet the opposite
partition upon which it was to rest.
Had it been continued on the original
plan, it must infallibly have met
the wall at about one-half of its height,
and this it was necessary to avoid.
This state of things very forcibly
claimed my attention; when one of
the ants, arriving at the place, and
visited the works, appeared to be
struck by the difficulty which presented
itself; but this it as soon obviated,
by taking down the ceiling and raising
the wall upon which it reposed. It
then, in my presence, constructed a
new ceiling with the fragments of the
former one.</p>

<p>"When the ants commence any
undertaking, one would suppose that
they worked after some preconceived
idea, which indeed would seem verified
by the execution. Thus, should
any ant discover upon the nest, two
stalks of plants, which lie cross-ways,
a disposition favourable to the construction
of a lodge; or some little
beams that may be useful in forming
its angles and sides, it examines the
several parts with attention, then distributes
with much sagacity and address
parcels of earth, in the spaces,
and along the stems, taking from
every quarter materials adapted to its
object, sometimes not caring to destroy
the work that others had commenced;
so much are its motions regulated
by the idea it has conceived,
and upon which it acts, with little attention
to all else around it. It goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
and returns, until the plan is sufficiently
understood by its companions."</p>

<p>"From these observations, and a
thousand similar, I am convinced that
each ant acts independently of its
companions. The first who conceives
a plan of easy execution, immediately
gives the sketch of it: others have
only to continue what this has begun,
judging, from an inspection of
the first labours, in what they ought
to engage. They can all lay down
plans, and continue to polish or retouch
their work as occasion requires.
The water furnishes the cement they
require, and the sun and air hardens
the materials of which their edifice
is composed. They have no other
chisel than their teeth, no other compass
than their antennæ, and no other
trowel than their fore-feet, of which
they make use in an admirable manner,
to affix and consolidate the moistened
earth."</p>

<p>We have thus some idea of that
masonry which erects the abodes familiar
to every eye, though the execution
may not be familiar to many
minds. The second chapter contains
an account of the eggs, larvæ pupæs;
and here other marvels are unfolded.
In the ants nest are males whose sole
business is to perpetuate the species
and die; females who are waited upon
like peeresses in their own right, who
neither toil nor spin, but are served
by neutrals, labourers, who tend their
innumerable eggs, nourish and unfold
the larvæ, and in short, do all the duties
of mothers, nurses, and menials.
The author devised means to observe
their internal economy; and he
says&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let us now open the shutter
which conceals from us the interior
of the ant hill, and let us see what is
passing there.</p>

<p>"Here the pupæ are heaped up
by hundreds in their spacious lodges;
there the larvæ are collected together,
and guarded by workers. In
one place, we observe an assemblage
of eggs, in another place, some of the
workers seem occupied in following
an ant of larger size than the rest;&mdash;this
is the mother, or at least one of
the females, for there are always several
in each ant-hill:&mdash;she lays as
she walks, and the guardians, by whom
she is surrounded, take up her eggs,
or seize them at the very moment of
her laying them; they collect them
together, and carry them in little
heaps in their mouths.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> On looking
a little closer, we find that they turn
them continually with their tongues;
it even appears, they pass them one
after the other between their teeth,
and thus keep them constantly moistened.
Such is the first <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apercu</i> which
my glazed aparatus offered.</p>

<p>"Having directed my close attention
to these eggs, I remarked they
were of different sizes, shades and
forms. The smallest were white,
opake, and cylindrical; the largest,
transparent, and slightly arched at
both ends; those of a middle were
semi-transparent. In holding them
up to the light, I observed a sort of
white oblong cloud; in some, a transparent
point might be remarked at
the superior extremity; in others,
a clear zone above and underneath
the little cloud. The largest presented
a single opake and whitish
point in their interior. There were
some whose whole body was so remarkably
clear as to allow of my
observing very distinctly the rings.
In fixing my attention more closely
upon the latter, I observed the egg
open, and the larva appear in its
place."</p>

<p>"I have been enabled to observe
through the glasses of my artificial
ant-hill, the great care taken of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
little worms, which bear also the
name of Larvæ. They were generally
guarded by a body of ants, who,
raised upon their feet, with their abdomen
brought between these members,
were prepared to cast their venom
upon all intruders, whilst here
and there, other workers were engaged
in clearing the passages, by
removing the materials which were
out of place: a great number of their
companions taking at the same time
their repose, and appearing to be fast
asleep: but a busy scene occurred at
the moment of transporting their little
ones to enjoy the warmth of the
sun. When the sun's rays fell upon
the exterior portion of the nest, the
ants, who were then on the surface,
descended with great rapidity to the
bottom of the ant-hill, struck with
their antennæ the other ants, ran one
after the other, and jostled their companions,
who mounted at the moment
under the bell glass, and redescended
with the same speed, putting in their
turn the whole colony in motion, so
that we could observe a swarm of
workers, filling up all the passages;
but what proved still more their intention
by these movements, was, the
violence with which the workers
sometimes seized, with their mandibles,
those who did not appear to understand
them, dragging them forth
to the top of the ant-hill, and immediately
leaving them, to go and seek
those still remaining with the young.</p>

<p>"As soon as the ants had intimation
of the appearance of the sun,
they occupied themselves with the
larvæ and pupæ; they carried them
with all expedition above the ant-hill,
where they left them exposed to the
influence of the heat. Their ardour
suffered no relaxation; the female
larvæ (which are heavier, and much
larger than those of the other cast)
were carried passages, leading from
the interior to the exterior of the
ant-hill, and placed in the sun, by the
side of those of the workers and
males. After remaining there a quarter
of an hour, the ants again took
them up, and sheltered them from
the direct rays of the sun, by placing
them in chambers, situated under a
layer of straw, which did not entirely
intercept the heat.</p>

<p>The workers, after having fulfilled
the duties imposed upon them in regard
to the larvæ, did not forget themselves;
they sought, in their turn, to
stretch themselves in the sun, lay
upon each other in heaps, and seemed
to enjoy some repose, but it was
of no long duration. I observed a
great number constantly employed
on the surface of the ant-hill, and
others engaged in carrying back the
larvæ, in proportion as the sun declined.
The moment of nourishing
them being at length arrived, each
ant approached a larva, and offered
it food. "The larvæ of ants," observes
M. Latreille, "resemble, when
they quit the egg, little white worms
destitute of feet, thick short, and in
form almost conical; their body is
composed of twelve rings: the anterior
part is slender and curved. We
remark at the head two little horny
pieces or hooks, too distant from each
other to be regarded as true teeth;
under these hooks we observe four
little points or <i>cils</i>, two on each side,
and a <i>mamelon</i>, or tubercular process,
almost cylindrical, soft, and retractile,
by which the larva receives its
food."</p>

<h2>FATA MORGANA.</h2>


<p>This singular and curious phenomenon,
which is occasionally seen
near the Bay of Naples, and which is
nearly allied to the <em>mirage</em>, so well
known in the east, was observed in
Huntingdonshire, during the late hot
weather. The sun was shining in a
cloudless sky, and the light vapours
arising from the river Ouze, were
hovering over a little hill, near St.
Noet's when suddenly the village of
Great Paxton, its farm-houses, barns,
dispersed cottages, and indeed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
whole of its beautiful and picturesque
scenery were distinctly visible in these
vapours, forming a splendid aerial
picture, which extended from east to
west for several hundred yards. This
natural panorama lasted for about ten
minutes, and was visible from a neighbouring
declivity, about half a mile
from Great Paxton.</p>

<p>The neuroptera, or <em>nerve-winged</em>
insects, have four wings, which are
membranaceous, naked, and so interspersed
with delicate veins, that they
have the appearance of beautiful network.
Their tail has no sting; but that
of the male is frequently furnished
with a kind of forceps or pincers. The
genera are:&mdash;1. <i>Libellula</i>, dragon-fly.&mdash;2.
<i>Ephemera</i>, May-fly, or trout-fly,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The <i>libellula</i>, or dragon-fly, is an
insect of very splendid and variegated
colours. It is a large and well known
fly, and frequents rivers, lakes, pools,
and stagnating waters, in which the
females deposit their eggs. The egg,
when deposited by the parent in the
water, sinks to the bottom, and remains
there till the young insect
has acquired sufficient maturity and
strength to burst from its confinement.
The larva, at first small increases
to nearly half the size of the
perfect fly, by changing its skin at
different intervals like the caterpillars
of moths and butterflies. The
appearance of the little cases containing
the rudiments of the wings, at
the lower margin of the thorax, denotes
its change to the state of pupa.
The head of this larva is exceedingly
singular, being covered with a mask
extending over the whole of the fore
part of the head, with cavities in the
anterior surface to suit the different
prominences of the face to which it is
fitted with perfect neatness. Its form
is triangular, growing smaller towards
the bottom: in the latter part there
is a knuckle which fits a cavity near
the neck, and on this part it turns as
on a pivot. The upper part of this
mask is divided into two pieces, which
the insect can open or close at pleasure,
and it can also let down the
whole mask, should occasion require.
The inner edges of these two pieces
are toothed like a saw, and serve the
animal as a pair of forceps to seize
and retain its prey. This is the general
principle on which these projecting
forceps are constructed in the
larva of the libellulæ; they differ in
shape in the several species, but uniformly
act in a similar manner.</p>

<p>These animals generally live and
feed at the bottom of water, swimming
only occasionally. Their motion
in the water can scarcely be called
swimming; it is accomplished by
sudden jerks repeated at intervals.
This motion is not occasioned by their
legs, which at this time are kept immoveable
and close to the body: it
is by forcing out a stream of water
from the tail that the body is carried
forward, as may be easily perceived
by placing them in a flat vessel, in
which there is only just water enough
to cover the bottom. Here the action
of the water squirted from their
tail will be very visible; it will occasion
a small current, and give sensible
motion to any light bodies that are
lying on the surface. This action
can only be effected at intervals, because
after each ejaculation the insect
is obliged to take a fresh supply
of water. The larva will sometimes
turn its tail above the surface of the
water, and force out a small stream,
as from a little fountain, and with considerable
force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the same order is comprehended
the <i>phryganea</i>, or spring-fly:
the caterpillars of this genus live in
the water, and are covered with a
silken tube. They have a very singular
aspect; for, by means of a gluten,
they attach to the tubes in which
they are enclosed small pieces of
wood, sand, gravel, leaves of plants,
and not unfrequently live on testaceous
animals, all of which they drag
along with them. They are very
commonly found on the leaves of the
water-cress; and, as they are often
entirely covered with them, they have
the appearance of animated plants.
They are in great request among
fishermen, by whom they are distinguished
by the name of stone or cod-bait.
The fly, or perfect insect, frequents
running water, in which the
females deposit their eggs.</p>

<h2>CHEAP AND ELEGANT CARPETS.</h2>


<p>On the 6th of September, the Society
for the encouragement of national
industry at Paris, granted to
Mr. Chenavard, (Boulevard St. Antoine,
No. 65, Paris) the premium of
1200 francs, which had been promised
to the person who could manufacture,
at the lowest price, the kind of
carpet best calculated for low and
damp habitations. The most complete
success in the making of this
article rewarded the exertions of Mr.
C. whose manufacturing ingenuity,
in a great variety of branches is well
known, and who is particularly celebrated
for his rich and tasty <em>paper
and stuff hangings</em>. Mr. C. has most
satisfactorily fulfilled the proposed
object of the said Society, and it is asserted
impossible better to combine,
in that branch of industry, cheapness,
elegance and solidity. The new invented
article is a sort of varnished
felt, far superior to any thing of the
kind that was ever manufactured in
England, with which stone floors,
marbles, mosaics, and even the finest
carpets of Persia can be imitated. It
is not dearer than the coarsest mats.
A square foot of it may be purchased
for 4 sols: so that the quantity which
is necessary for a room 24 feet by 20,
would amount to no more than 48
francs, or about 9 dollars. 14 cents.
Mr. C. is now giving his attention to
a new kind of winter carpet, which its
cheapness and superior qualities will
make a valuable acquisition to the
lovers of comfort.</p>

<h2>CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS IN
HOLLAND.</h2>


<p>After passing through the small
town of Liss, the road continued with
the sandhills in perfect barrenness till
we approached that city; whose entrance
is decorated with country seats
of considerable magnificence and
beautiful flower gardens which supply
bulbs to the horticulturists of their
own country, as well as furnish the
most beautiful specimens of flowers
to the rest of Europe.</p>

<p>The attention of the cultivation of
flower roots and seeds, independent
of the elegance of the pursuit, has by
the profits it has brought become an
object of some importance. It is the
source of prosperity to many respectable
families, and in some measure
lays all Europe under obligations
which are repaid by profit to the cultivators.
The number of flower-gardeners
is not above twelve or thirteen,
but the operations of each are very
extensive. It is said, that there are
more than twenty acres of land devoted
solely to the cultivation of hyacinths,
and a large portion to tulips,
and other flowers. These flowers are
principally sold when in full bloom in
Amsterdam, where there is a weekly
market on Sunday afternoon, and the
whole of Monday; the trade, however,
has vastly declined of late years,
having sunk in weekly returns from
15,000 to 3,000 florins. The tulip
mania which afflicted Holland in the
years 1636 and 1637, and which involved
so many families in ruin, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
long ceased; but in 1730, a hyacinth-mania,
inferior to it indeed, but equally
ridiculous, prevailed: and speculations
were made in those flowers to a
considerable extent, so that some single
bulbs were sold as high as sixty
or seventy pounds. There can be no
doubt but the taste for cultivating
flower gardens, which has extended
itself over almost the whole of Europe,
may be traced to this country,
which furnishes bulbs and seeds till
the intervention of successive wars
and their interruptions to communication,
induced the other nations to
propagate those flowers at home,
whose growth was most congenial to
their soil and climate.</p>

<h2>A VISIT TO TWO NUNNERIES IN
ROME.</h2>


<p>I obtained permission to visit the
nunnery called "Tor di Specchio,"
one of the richest and most respectable
of Rome, having twenty-one nuns,
great rents, and requiring one thousand
eight hundred dollars of expenses
for the ceremony of vestire.
I was received in a room just beyond
the grate in which the confessor of
the convent, a red faced, good natured
looking man, was warming himself;
a 'converse' spinning flax, and
the sister whose duty it was to wait
in the room for the week. In the
garden, great numbers of roses and
other flowers were cultivated. I was
led through several corridors, at the
end of each of which was placed an
image of the Saviour or the Virgin,
with a lamp burning before it. In
the corridor of the second story, the
cells of the sisters were situated, each
covered towards the passage by a
large green curtain. These cells
looked into the garden, and opposite
each door in the corridor was placed
a large stand of ashes, at which the
nuns cooked their morning chocolate
and warmed themselves. The dining
room was large, and the tables were
well covered with green baize. In
the middle of the room there was a
pulpit, from which a sister read in
turn religious works during the
meals, a practice which prevails in
nearly all Roman convents; the word
"Silentium," in large letters, was cut
deep in a stone over the principal
door. The kitchen was large, but
dirty. In this nunnery there were
three chapels, one church for summer
and another for winter. I was
suffered to enter the cell of the superior,
who received me with great
courtesy. She was sitting upon a
bed, that she had not left for three
years, spinning flax, and holding a
large rosary in one hand. She was
at that time eighty-three years of age,
and had entered the convent at twelve
for her education, which she had never
left since that hour, having been
suffered to remain during the French
time. She spoke much, and with
great vivacity. There were six or
seven straw bottomed chairs in her
little cell, a handsome, but old fashioned
clock, a small wardrobe and a
few religious prints. In several cells,
which happened to be open as I passed,
I saw books, flowers in the windows&mdash;a
harpsichord, a harp and
some other musical instruments. In
this convent, meat is eaten four times
a week, and the order of the day is as
follows, much resembling that of all
convents. In summer they get up
at five. Prayers last an hour and a
half; breakfast at seven&mdash;prayer till
eight&mdash;prayers again at ten&mdash;dine at
eleven&mdash;after dinner sleep&mdash;evening
office at four&mdash;supper at six, and bed
at eight. In the intervals of meals
and offices, the sisters read pious
books, talk, walk, embroider, tear lint
for hospitals, or do coarse work.
They confess themselves and take
the sacrament every eight days; they
confess themselves to a priest named
by the head of the order; he is changed
several times a year. The person,
who conducted me, was a princess
of a Roma family. She had
taken the veil twenty-one years ago,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
but possessed perfect ease, simplicity
and courtesy. She spoke of those
matters, which are always subjects of
conversation in drawing rooms of antiquities,
carnivals, deaths of queens,
&amp;c. Her dress was coarse black, and
by no means neat. She was perfectly
affable, and answered with great
complaisance numerous troublesome
questions. Indeed, there was not the
slightest tinge of gloom, or solitude,
or austerity about this convent, or in
the appearance and manners of the
few nuns, whom I happened to see.
I recollect hearing an aged Roman
lady, who possessed a vast experience
in courts, convents, drawing-rooms,
boudoirs, and of every thing else
which relates to the world, remark
some time after that of all creatures
she had ever seen, the most amiable
in their manners, and good natured,
were nuns.</p>

<p><i>Vive Seppolte.</i>&mdash;As its name denotes,
the nuns of this convent never
see the face of any human being but
of the inmates of it. They confess
themselves to a confessor through a
brass plate, pierced with small holes;
they are allowed to hold converse
with their friends only once a year,
through a similar plate. No window
or any kind of opening looks upon a
street or any sort of building; all the
light comes from their own courtyard.
They wear woollen next their
skin, which is changed only once a
month, sleep in their clothes upon
straw, and wear pieces of leather tied
about their feet. At the restoration
of the pope all returned, excepting
one, who went to a similar convent at
Albano. They have now fifty-four
nuns, and one of them unluckily possesses
a large fortune. No convent
in Rome receives such abundant
charity. At the head of the staircase,
leading to this nunnery, a large
solid barrel, girt with iron, and divided
into eight parts, is fixed into
the thick wall of the building, and
made to turn, so that articles may be
conveyed from and into the convent.
We knocked upon this wall and immediately
a voice answered from
within, "Praise be to our Lord Jesus
Christ," and said, "what come ye to
seek?" We desired to speak with
the abbess. Whereupon the invisible
rung a bell, and turning the barrel,
a key was brought to our view,
that was taken by a man, who had
appeared at the ringing, and who unlocked
the "parlatoire," a small
room, in one corner of which was a
plate of copper, twelve or fourteen
inches square, fixed in the wall, and
pierced with the finest holes imaginable.</p>

<p>The abbess now spoke to us from
the other side of the plate, "I salute
you in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ." This person had a lively
voice and cheerful manner, and she
spoke with perfect freedom and willingness
about her own concerns and
those of the convent. She told us
that she had taken the veil thirty-eight
years ago, and had been made abbess
at the restoration. She said moreover,
that the sisters were happy, enjoyed
good health, and that she had never
seen a dissatisfied look, or heard a
repentant wish. This was no doubt
true; people are contented in many
conditions worse than that of the Vive
Seppolte, and conditions, too, which
they never regard as probations or
martyrdoms, to be rewarded in another
world. In 1815 the Pope had
permitted this convent to be re-established,
and since that time not a human
face, beyond those of the sisterhood,
had been seen by any inhabitants
of it. Judging from the sound
of this woman's voice, and her rapid,
pleasant, and animated conversation,
it is evident that she had neither regretted
nor suffered much from this
deprivation. She appeared to have
vast vivacity, and much playfulness
of mind, and was a great talker. Still
it did not often befal her to speak to
foreigners through the grate, and
much allowance ought to be made for
the excitement which a similar situation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
doubtless awakened. When a
small tribute was turned upon the
barrel into the convent, she said "God
has sent us this gift." "Those, who
sent it, will be remembered in our
prayers."</p>

<p>Having seen and heard much of
the convents of Rome, I am satisfied
that the inhabitants of them do
not condemn themselves to many deprivations
and mortifications, which
they would not have suffered in the
ordinary chances of a different life;
that the passions, which exist there,
are less active, violent and frequent,
and that the carelessness of mind,
health of body, and absence from all
gloom and severity, utterly contradict
and put to shame the theories
and creeds of the world. One cannot
discourse too long upon the impossibility
of ascertaining the relative
amount of happiness in the different
courses of life to which habit,
inclination, or chance, may call. A
foreign gentleman, who had lived
twenty years in Rome, told me that
he had never heard of any scandalous
conduct in any nunnery during
all that time.</p>

<h2>ANTISEPTIC POWER OF THE PYROLIGNEOUS
ACID.</h2>


<p>Results of some experiments made
by Mr. W. Ramsay.&mdash;</p>

<p>A number of herrings were cleaned
on the 10th of July, 1819; and
without being salted, were immersed
for three hours in distilled pyroligneous
acid, specified gravity 1012.
When withdrawn they were softened
and not so firm as fish taken out of
common pickle. They were hung
up in the shade; July and August
were hot months, but the herrings
had no signs of putrefaction about
them, but had a very wholesome
smell, combined with that of the acid.
One being broiled the empyreumatic
smell was very strong. The rest, after
six months, were in complete preservation.</p>

<p>It was afterwards found that the
period of immersion had been too
long. If the fish are simply dipped
in acid of specific gravity 1012, and
dried in the shade, it is sufficient for
their preservation; and such herrings,
when boiled, are very agreeable
and have not the disagreeable empyreuma
of the former.</p>

<p>A number of haddocks were cleaned,
split, and slightly sprinkled with
salt for six hours; then being drained,
dipped for about three seconds in
pyroligneous acid, and hung in the
shade for eight days. On being
broiled, they were of an uncommonly
fine flavour, delicately white, and
equal to the highly esteemed Finnan
Haddock.</p>

<p>Herrings were cured in the same
way as the haddocks. After being
dried in the shade for two months,
they were equal in quality and flavour
to the best red herrings. The fish
retained the shining and fresh appearance
they had when taken from the
sea.</p>

<p>A piece of fresh beef was dipped
for one minute in pyroligneous acid
of specific gravity 1012, in July 1819.
On March 4, 1820, it was as free
from taint as when first immersed.
No salt was used in this experiment.
A piece of beef was dipped in at the
same time in pure vinegar, of specific
gravity 1009. It was perfectly free
from taint on the 18th of November.
This experiment indicates antiseptic
powers in pure vinegar; some haddocks
were cured with it, which remained
free from taint, but when
cooked had an insipid taste.</p>

<p>When beef is partially salted, and
then steeped for a short time in the
pyroligneous acid, after being drained
and cooked, it has the same flavor
as Hamburg beef.</p>

<p>Mr. Ramsay has no doubt, that with
proper modifications, the use of the
acid may be extended to the preservation
of every species of animal food.</p>

<p>In order to ascertain whether the
volatile oil in the pyroligneous acid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
or the acid itself, was the agent to
prevent putrefaction, Mr. Ramsay
dipped haddocks and fresh beef in
pure vinegar of specific gravity 1009.
When fish were allowed to remain in
the vinegar a few minutes, he observed
that the muscular fibre was
immediately acted on, a partial solution
of the fish took place, and the
acid became milky. When vinegar
of a stronger quality was used, the
fish was entirely dissolved, particularly
if aided by heat. Both fish and
beef which were dipped in vinegar,
of specific gravity 1009, and which
were afterwards dried in a summer
heat, remained for a long time after
perfectly free from taint.</p>

<p>Mr. Stodart has repeated some of
these experiments, and especially
those relating to the haddocks, with
perfect success in London.</p>


<hr class="chap" />
<p class="center">FOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.</p>


<p>The following plan for preparing
cheap and nutricious food, received
from a friend in England, was about
a year ago extensively circulated in
this country, by means of several of
the daily journals. Whether its utility,
has to any considerable extent,
been tested by practice is unknown
to the writer; but as it is believed to
be worthy of preservation, and as
economy should still continue to be
the order of the day, its republication
may possibly be useful.</p>


<h2>CHEAP, WHOLESOME, AND SAVORY
FOOD.</h2>

<p>Take one pound of <span class="smcap">Rice</span>, steep it
in cold water for at least one hour,
(longer would be better;) then put it
into boiling water, and, if previously
steeped enough, it will be sufficiently
boiled in about five minutes; then
pour off the water, and dry it on the
fire, as in cooking potatoes.</p>

<p>Use it with the following gravy or
sauce: two or three ounces of mutton
suet, fried with onions until done
enough; then add some flour and
water, (as in making gravy,) with
salt and about as much Cayenne pepper,
as will lie on a sixpence, (or
twelve and a half cent piece;) the
different ingredients, however, may
be varied to the taste.</p>

<p>At the present wholesale prices of
<span class="smcap">Rice</span>, the above would only cost about
three pence, (a fraction more than
<em>five and a half cents</em>,) and would be
sufficient meal for <em>a family of six
persons</em>.</p>

<p>I will merely add, that having eaten
of the food prepared in exact conformity
with the foregoing directions,
it was found by no means unpalatable.</p>

<p class="sig">I.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2>GINGER.</h2>


<p>The cultivation of this root is nearly
similar to that of potatoes. The
land is first well cleansed from weeds;
it is then dug into trenches similar to
those which gardeners, make for celery;
and the plants are set in these
trenches in March or April. They
flower about September and in January
or February; when the stalks
are withered, the roots are in a proper
state to be dug up.&mdash;These are
prepared for use in two ways. When
intended for what is called <em>white ginger</em>,
they are picked, scraped, separately
washed, and afterwards dried
with great care by exposure in the
sun. For <em>black ginger</em>, they are picked,
cleansed, immersed in boiling water
and dried. This process is much
less laborious and expensive than the
other; consequently the price of the
article is not so great. By boiling,
the ginger loses a portion of its essential
oil, and its black colour is owing
to this.</p>

<p>The use of ginger, both in medicine,
and as a spice, are numerous
and well known. In the West Indies,
it is frequently eaten fresh in sallads,
and with other food, and the roots
when dug up young, namely, at the
end of three or four months after
they have been planted, are preserved
in syrup, and exported as a sweet
meat to nearly all parts of the world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
The ginger brought from the East
Indies is much stronger than that
coming from Jamaica.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>WARS OF THE ANTS.</h2>


<p>"The guard or sentry of the ant-hill
will furnish us with the first proof
of their social relations. We could,
without doubt, irritate ants on the
surface of the nest, without alarming
those in the interior, if they acted
isolately, and had no means of communicating
their mutual impressions.
Those who are occupied at the bottom
of their nest, removed from the
scene of danger, ignorant of what
menaces their companions, could not
arrive to their assistance; but it appears,
that they are quickly and well
informed of what is passing on the
exterior. When we attack those
without, the most part engage in their
defence with a considerable degree
of courage; there are always some,
who immediately steal off and produce
alarm throughout their city;
the news is communicated from quarter
to quarter, and the labourers come
forward in a crowd, with every mark
of uneasiness and anger. What however,
is highly worthy our remark is
that the ants, to whose charge the
young are confided, and who inhabit
the upper stories, where the temperature
is highest, warned also of the
impending danger, always governed
by that extreme solicitude for their
charge, which we have so often admired,
hasten to convey them to the
deepest part of their habitation, and
thus deposit them in a place of safety.</p>

<p>"To study in detail the manner in
which this alarm spreads over the ant-hill,
we must extend our observations
to the individuals of the largest species:
the Herculean Ants, who inhabit
hollow trees and who quit them
only in the spring, to accompany the
males and females, have very much
assisted me in this object.</p>

<p>"The labourers are from five to
six lines in length; the winged individuals
are also proportionally large;
they may be frequently seen running
about the trunk of an oak, at the entrance
of their labyrinths. When I
disturbed those ants that were at the
greatest distance from their companions,
by either observing them too
closely, or blowing upon them lightly,
I saw them run towards the other
ants, give them gentle blows with
their heads against the corslet, communicating
to them in this way, their
fear or anger, passing rapidly from
one to the other in a semicircular direction,
and striking several times
successively against those who did not
put themselves in instant motion.
These, warned of their common danger,
set off immediately, describing
in their turn different curves, and
stopping to strike with their heads all
those they met on their passage. In
one moment the signal was general,
all the labourers ran over the surface
of the tree with great agitation, those
within receiving notice of the danger,
and probably by the same means,
came out in a crowd and joined this
tumult. The same signal which produced
upon the workers this effect,
caused a different impression upon
the males and females; as soon as
one of the labourers had informed
them of their danger, they sought an
asylum, and re-entered precipitately
the trunk of the tree;&mdash;not one
thought of quitting its temporary
shelter, until a worker approached
and gave them the signal for flight.
The solicitude of the labourers in
their favour, is manifested in the activity
they display, in giving them advice
or intimating to them the order
for their departure; they redouble
then the above signals, as if conscious
of their understanding their intent
less readily than the companions of
their labours; the latter understand
them, if I may use the expression, at
half a word."</p>

<p>"Of all the enemies of the ant,
those most dreaded are the ants themselves;
the smallest not the least, since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
several fasten at once upon the feet
of the largest, drag them to the
ground, embarrass their movements,
and thus prevent their escape. One
would be astonished at the fury of
these insects in their combats; it
would be more easy to tear away
their limbs and cut them to pieces,
than compel them to quit their hold.
It is nothing uncommon to see the
head of an ant suspended to the legs
or antennæ of some worker, who
bears about, in every place, this pledge
of his victory. We also observe, not
unfrequently, the ants dragging after
them the entire body of some enemy
they had killed some time before,
fastened to their feet in such a way
as not to allow of their disengaging
themselves.</p>

<p>"Supposing the ants to be of equal
size, those furnished with a sting have
an advantage over those who employ
only for their defence their venom
and their teeth. The whole of those
ants whose peduncles has no scale,
but one or two knots, are provided
with a sting; the Red Ants, which
are said to sting more sharply than the
rest, possess both these sorts of arms.
In general the ants furnished with a
sting are, in our country, some of
the smallest. I know but one species
of middle size; but it is very rare
and only inhabits the Alps.</p>

<p>"The wars entered into by ants of
different size bear no resemblance to
those in which ants engage who come
to combat with an equal force. When
the large attack the small, they appear
to do it by surprise, most likely
to prevent the latter from fastening
upon their legs; they seize them in
the upper part of the body and strangle
them immediately between their
pincers. But when the small ants
have time to guard against an attack,
they intimate to their companions the
danger with which they are threatened,
when the latter arrive in crowds
to their assistance. I have witnessed
a battle between the Herculean and
the Sanguine Ants; the Herculean
Ants quitted the trunk of the tree in
which they had established their
abode, and arrived to the very gates
of the dwelling of the Sanguine Ants;
the latter, only half the size of their
adversaries, had the advantage in point
of number; they however acted on
the defensive. The earth, strewed
with the dead bodies of their compatriots,
bore witness they had suffered
the greatest carnage; they therefore,
took the prudent part of fixing
their habitation elsewhere, and with
great activity transported to a distance
of fifty feet from the spot, their
companions, and the several objects
that interested them. Small detachments
of the workers were posted at
little distances from the nest, apparently
placed there to cover the march
of the retreats and to preserve the
city itself from any sudden attack.
They struck against each other when
they met, and had always their mandibles
separated in the attitude of defiance.
As soon as the Herculean
Ants approached their camp, the centinals
in front assailed them with fury;
they fought at first in single combat.
The Sanguine Ant threw himself
upon the Herculean Ant, fastened
upon its head, turned its abdomen
against the chest of its adversary or
against the lower part of its mouth,
and inundated it with venom. It
sometimes quitted its antagonist with
great quickness: more frequently,
however, the Herculean Ant held between
its feet its audacious enemy.
The two champions then rolled themselves
in the dust and struggled violently.
The advantage was at first in
favour of the largest ant; but its adversary
was soon assisted by those of
its own party who collected around
the Herculean Ant and inflicted several
deep wounds with their teeth.
The Herculean Ant yielded to numbers<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>;
it either perished the victim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
of its temerity, or was conducted a
prisoner to the enemy's camp.</p>

<p>"Such are the combats between
ants of different size; but if we wish
to behold regular armies war in all
its form, we must visit those forests
in which the Fallow Ants establish
their dominion over every insect in
their territory. We shall there see
populous and rival cities, regular
roads passing from the ant hill as so
many rays from a centre, and frequently
by an immense number of
combatants, wars between hordes of
the same species for they are naturally
enemies and jealous of the territory
which borders their own capital.
It is in these forests I have witnessed
the inhabitants of two large
ant-hills engaged in spirited combat.
I cannot pretend to say what occasioned
discord between these republics.
They were composed of ants of the
same species, alike in their extent and
population; and were situated about
a hundred paces distance from each
other. Two empires could not possess
a greater number of combatants.</p>

<p>"Let us figure to ourselves this
prodigious crowd of insects covering
the ground lying between these
two ant-hills, and occupying a space
of two feet in breadth. Both armies
met at half-way from their respective
habitations, and there the battle commenced.
Thousands of ants took
their station upon the highest ground,
and fought in pairs, keeping firm hold
of their antagonists by their mandibles;
a considerable number were engaged
in the attack and leading away
prisoners. The latter made several
ineffectual efforts to escape, as if
aware that, upon their arrival at the
camp, they would experience a cruel
death. The scene of warfare occupied
a space of about three feet
square; a penetrating odour exhaled
from all sides; numbers of dead ants
were seen covered with venom.
Those ants composing groups and
chains, took hold of each other's legs
and pincers, and dragged their antagonists
on the ground. These
groups formed successively. The
fight usually commenced between
two ants, who seized each other by
the mandibles, and raised themselves
upon their hind legs, to allow of their
bringing their abdomen forward, and
spirting the venom upon their adversary.
They were frequently so
closely wedged together that they fell
upon their sides, and fought a long
time in that situation, in the dust;
they shortly after raised themselves,
when each began dragging its adversary;
but when their force was equal,
the wrestlers remained immoveable,
and fixed each other to the ground,
until a third came to decide the contest.
It more commonly happened
that both ants received assistance at
the same time, when the whole four,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
keeping firm hold of a foot or antenna,
made ineffectual attempts to gain
the battle. Some ants joined the latter,
and these were, in their turn
seized by new arrivals. It was in this
way they formed chains of six, eight,
or ten ants, all firmly locked together;
the equilibrium was only broken
when several warriors, from the
same republic, advanced at the same
time, who compelled those that were
enchained to let go their hold, when
the single combats again took place.
On the approach of night each party
returned gradually to the city, which
served it for an asylum. The ants,
which were either killed or led away
into captivity, not being replaced by
others, the number of combatants
diminished, until their force was exhausted.</p>

<p>"The ants returned to the field of
battle before dawn. The groups
again formed; the carnage recommenced
with greater fury than on
the preceding evening, and the scene
of combat occupied a space of six
feet in length, by two, in breadth.
Success was for a long time doubtful;
about mid-day the contending armies
had removed to the distance of a dozen
feet from one of their cities,
whence I conclude some ground had
been gained. The ants fought so
desperately, that nothing could withdraw
them from their enterprize;
they did not even perceive my presence,
and although I remained close
to the army, none of them climbed
upon my legs; they seemed absorbed
in one object, that of finding an enemy
to contend with."</p>

<h2>THE DIAMOND.</h2>


<p>Of all transparent substances, none
can be compared to the brilliancy
of the diamond; and its hardness is
such, that no kind of steel instrument
can make any impression upon it.
Notwithstanding which, it has been
proved that the diamond is but carbon
or charcoal, in a pure or chrystallized
state. When strongly heated,
it consumes entirely away. Diamonds,
when rubbed together, have a peculiarly,
and scarcely to be described
grating sound, which is remarkably
characteristic of this gem; so that by
this circumstance alone, rough diamonds
may be accurately and expeditiously
distinguished from every
other gem. When the diamond is
rubbed, it will attract bits of straw,
feathers, hairs, and other small objects,
and if exposed to the rays of the
sun, and immediately taken into a dark
place, will appear luminous.</p>

<p>The largest diamond ever known,
is in the possession of the Queen of
Portugal, and weighs about eleven
ounces. It was found in Brazil, and
sent from thence to London, in the
year 1746. It is still uncut, and has
been valued at twenty-five million six
hundred thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Diamonds are much worn in England
as ornaments. When converted
into powder or dust, the diamond is
used with steel instruments to divide
pebbles and precious stones. Its use
in cutting glass is generally known.
Rock crystal, brought from Brazil, is
divided into leaves, and ground and
polished with diamond dust for spectacles,
and other optical instruments.</p>

<h2>EXTRACTS FROM WIRT.</h2>


<p>"Excessive wealth is neither glory
nor happiness. The cold and sordid
wretch, who thinks only of himself;
who draws his head within his shell
and never puts it out, but for the purposes
of lucre and ostentation&mdash;who
looks upon his fellow creatures not
only without sympathy, but with arrogance
and insolence, as if they were
made to be his vassals, and he was
made to be their lord&mdash;as if they
were formed for no other purpose
than to pamper his avarice, or to contribute
to his aggrandizement&mdash;such
a man may be rich, but trust me, that
he can never be happy, nor virtuous,
nor great. There is in fortune a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
golden mean, which is the appropriate
region of virtue and intelligence. Be
content with that; and if the horn of
plenty overflow, let its droppings fall
upon your fellow men; let them fall,
like the droppings of honey in the
wilderness, to cheer the faint and wayworn
pilgrim. I wish you indeed to
be distinguished; but wealth is not
essential to distinction. Look at the
illustrious patriots, philosophers and
philanthropists, who in various ages
have blessed the world; was it their
wealth that made them great? Where
was the wealth of Aristides, Socrates,
of Plato, of Epaminondas, of Fabricius,
of Cincinnatus, and a countless
host upon the rolls of fame. Their
wealth was in the mind and the heart.
Those are the treasures by which
they have been immortalized, and
such alone are the treasures that are
worth a serious struggle."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>ON THE ADVANTAGES OF NARROW
RESOURCES.</h2>


<p>In minds of a certain cast, the title
of this essay may possibly excite surprise.
It might be imagined that the
writer was guided in the choice of a
subject, as the Cynic was directed in
his tub, by that misanthropy which
affects to look on good and evil, with
an equal frown; or by that pride which
finding itself linked to poverty, strives
to dignify the despised partner of its
destiny. Yet, in spite of these suggestions,
much may be said in favour
of those narrow resources, which the
superficial view with pity, and the
worldling with scorn. And further,
the assertion may be hazarded, that
they are favourable to individual character
and happiness, as well as to
the general cause of literature and
virtue.</p>

<p>Repeated proofs of the first position,
may be drawn from the common
scenery of life.&mdash;Observe that boy, in
the early stages of his education.&mdash;Why
does he destroy his books, and
cast about him his pens and his pencils?
Why are his pages the repository
of blots, and deformed with dogs-ears,
and his volumes alternately his
sport, and his footstool? Because he
feels that his parents are able to purchase
more. Why does he occasionally
fix on their contents, a scowling
eye, and the bent brow of discontent?
Fear of present discipline, or a listless
desire of winning the dainties and
praises of parental indulgence, are
forcing a reluctant attention to his
lesson.</p>

<p>Mark that boy at his side. Why
does he so carefully use his scanty
writing materials, and so faithfully
return his books to their place, when
his task is finished? Because he has
learnt their value by the difficulty of
obtaining them. Why does he pursue
his studies with unremitting application,
yet with a cheerful countenance?
Because he considers it a
privilege to be permitted to acquire
knowledge, and his studies are but a
recreation from severer labours. His
mind takes its pastime along with its
nourishment, while his companion,
like a prisoner, is only anxious to escape
from durance. One, in toiling
to gain instruction, feels himself the
indebted party: the other, if he ever
submits to it, fancies he has conferred
a favour which entitles him to commendation
and reward. This diversity
of motive, will naturally produce
diversity of action; and action, long
continued, becomes confirmed into
habit. Time, while he palsies the
springs of energy, and quenches the
ardour of thought, adds force to those
habits, which indulgence has fostered
and nourished. And will it be supposed
that habits of carelessness,
watchfulness, and mental indolence,
continued through the important period
of school education, will have no
influence on the future character? Is
the productiveness of Autumn, not
affected by the poverty of the blossoms
of Spring; or the future symmetry
of the tree, uninjured by the
excrescences of the sapling? No one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
imagines that early habits of industry,
economy, and application, stamped on
the character in its formation, will
ever be wholly obliterated; why then,
is that state of fortune considered as
an evil, which aids their implantation
by the strength of necessity?</p>

<p>Mark that student at the University.
Why is he lounging in the fashionable
walks, ogling the ladies, displaying an
expensive dress, contracting bills at
the confectioner's and tailor's, late at
prayers, listless at recitations, satisfied
only in the resorts of folly, vanity, and
dissipation? Why does he return
home, uninformed in mind, undecided
in profession, tinctured with extravagance,
or involved in debt? Because
he knew his parents were rich, and
believed that wealth was a substitute,
both for science and for virtue.</p>

<p>Why does a youth from the same
neighbourhood, perhaps his inferior
in talents, maintain the first standing
in his class, and gain the honours of
his seminary? What heightens his
love of knowledge, brightens his eye
with intelligence, incites him to mark
every hour with diligence, every day
with duty; what enables him to scorn
luxurious indulgence, and to endure
privation with a noble hardiness of
soul? The consciousness that his family
are poor, and that by his own
exertions he must stand or fall.</p>

<p>Thus excited to perseverance, he
ascertains the extent of his own talents,
bends them to their proper objects,
brightens them by exercise, and
entrusts them "to the usurer, that
the Giver, at his coming, may receive
his own."&mdash;The indolent mind, weakened
by indulgence, views knowledge
as "an austere man," and committing
its talent to the earth, beholds its harvest
in the mildew, the mouldering,
and decay of its own powers.</p>

<p>Where a taste for literature exists,
and the means of attaining it are not
precluded, narrow resources are favourable
to its acquisition. Would
Johnson, the giant of English literature,
have gained the proud eminence
which he commands, without aid from
the strong hand of necessity? Did he
not even express gratitude, that the
touch of adversity had been appointed
to rouse him from the slumber of his
native indolence? Is it probable that
mankind would have been delighted
with the elegance of his "Prince of
Abyssinia," if affluence had enabled
him to discharge the mournful debt
of his mother's obsequies? Did not
the classical Beattie trace his ardour
of literary pursuit, and his premature
proficiency to the stimulus of his bursary
at Aberdeen? Did he not refer
some of the most descriptive stanzas
in his "Minstrel," to his state of seclusion
and poverty, when a parish
schoolmaster, and precentor, at the
foot of the Grampian Mountains?&mdash;Would
the Ayrshire ploughman's
"wild bird of heaven," have displayed
such varying plumage, such fearless
compass of tone, had it been confined
in a gilded cage, and pampered with
the enervating luxuries of fortune?</p>

<p>Whatever enforces mental application,
is favourable to mental improvement;
and nothing teaches the
lesson of application more thoroughly
than necessity. Whatever exercises
the inventive powers, is favourable to
genius, and necessity executes this
office so powerfully, that it is styled
even by the common people, "the
mother of invention." The affinity
between restricted resources, and virtue,
is of obvious perception. Habits
of self-denial, and self-control, insensibly
lead to moderated desires, and
inspire that content which is the secret
of happiness. A well-regulated mind,
by accustoming itself to privation, and
sacrifice, rises superior to selfish gratifications,
and improves in that disinterested
state of the affections, which
is one of the greatest objects of piety
to cultivate.&mdash;The man, whose narrow
possessions are the fruit of his
own industry, will better understand
their value, more studiously avoid the
vices that dissipate them, and more
conscientiously limit his expenses by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
his income.&mdash;Thus will he keep his
spirit unhumbled by the embarrassments
of debt, and his heart unchilled
by dread at the face of a creditor.
Rational economy, while it supplies
him with the means of rendering
every man his due, will prove also
the legitimate fountain of charity.
Profusion is no friend to pity; and
how can he have a right to be liberal,
whose debts are unpaid. The movings
of Charity are silenced, by the
"cry of the labourers whose wages
are kept back;" while he, whose industry
has satisfied the claims of justice,
may make glad the hearts of
theirs, while his own reproaches him
not. May we not suppose that the
remembrance of having ourselves
known want, would soften the feelings
to the wants of others? as a participation
in the sufferings of sickness,
creates deeper sympathy for the victims
of disease? Who, with a warmer
overflowing of charity, would impart
bread to the hungry, and a garment
to the shelterless, than the man, who
had himself felt the need of one, or by
his own labour obtained possession of
the other? A class of distresses, of
which the rich can have no conception,
he has entered into; and in his
humble gift there will be more charity,
than in the ample donations of
Pride, listening to hear Fame extol
her bounty. As the Israelites were
incited to hospitality, by the remembrance
that they had once "been
strangers in the land of Egypt," so
the heart that has endured the privations
of poverty, can better estimate,
and more feelingly relieve them.</p>

<p>If the happiness of any condition
be computed by its usefulness, by the
energies which it awakens, and the
virtues which it cherishes, may we
not believe, that many in making up
their account of life, will have reason
to bless the Almighty Disposer, that
they were shielded by his providence
from the enervating influence and the
dangerous temptations of wealth.</p>

<h2>ACCOUNT OF MAMMOTH CAVE,</h2>

<p class="noind"><i>in Kentucky and a remarkable
Mummy, or dried Indian woman
found in it</i>.</p>


<p>"I received information, that an
infant, of nine or twelve months old,
was discovered in a saltpetre Cave in
Warren county, about four miles from
the Mammoth Cave, in a perfect state
of preservation. I hastened to the
place; but, to my mortification, found
that, upon its being exposed to the
atmosphere, it had fallen into dust,
and that its remains, except the skull,
with all its clothing, had been thrown
into the furnace. I regretted this
much, and promised the labourers to
reward them, if they would preserve
the next subject for me. About a
month afterwards, the present one
was discovered, and information given
to our agent at the Mammoth Cave,
who sent immediately for it, and
brought and placed it there, where
it remained for twelve months. It
appeared to be the exsiccated body
of a female. The account which I
received of its discovery, was simply
this. It was found at the depth of
about ten feet from the surface of the
Cave, bedded in clay, strongly impregnated
with nitre, placed in a sitting
posture, incased in broad stones,
standing on their edges, with a flat
stone covering the whole. It was enveloped
in coarse clothes, (a specimen
of which accompanied it) the
whole wrapped in deer skins, the hair
of which was shaved off in the manner
in which the Indians prepare
them for market. Enclosed in the
stone coffin, were the working utensils,
beads, feathers, and other ornaments
of dress, which belonged to
her. The body was in a state of much
higher perfection, when first discovered,
and continued so, as long as it
remained in the Mammoth Cave,
than it is at present, except the depredations
committed on its arms and
thighs by the rats, many of which inhabit
the Cave. After it was brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
to Lexington, and become the subject
of great curiosity, being much
exposed to the atmosphere, it gradually
began to decay, its muscles to
contract, and the teeth to drop out,
and much of its hair was plucked
from its head by wanton visitants.
As to the manner of its being embalmed,
or whether the nitrous earth
and atmosphere had a tendency to
preserve it, must be left to the speculations
of the learned.</p>

<p>The Cave in which the Mummy
was found, is not of great extent, not
being more than three quarters of
a mile in length; its surface, covered
with loose limestone, from four to
six feet deep, before you enter the
clay impregnated with nitre. It is
of easy access, being above twenty
feet wide, and six feet high, at the
mouth or entrance. It is enlarged to
about fifty feet wide, and ten feet high,
almost as soon as you enter it. This
place had evident marks of having
once been the residence of the aborigines
of the country, from the quantity
of ashes, and the remains of fuel,
and torches made of the reed, &amp;c.
which were found in it."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>RECEIPT FOR MAKING ECONOMICAL
BREAD.</h2>


<p>Separate the bran and grosser part;
from the flour; then take five pounds
of it (of 16 ounces) and boil them in
four gallons and three quarters of
water, so that when it is dissolved,
there shall remain three gallons and
three quarters of glutinous water.
With this knead fifty-six pounds of
flour, adding salt and yeast, in the
same manner and in the same proportion
as for other bread. When
the dough is ready to be put into the
oven, divide it into loaves and let it
bake for two hours and a half.</p>

<p>In this way the flour will imbibe
three quarters of a gallon more of
glutinous, than it would of simple
water, and will yield not only a more
nutritive and substantial food, but
likewise an increase of a fifth beyond
the quantity of common bread, a saving
of one day's consumption out
of six. Upon this plan, fifty-six
pounds of meal will yield eighty-three
pounds and a half of bread.
When this is quite stale (baked since
ten days) if it be put into the oven
and left there for twenty minutes, it
becomes fresh again, a very convenient
property in long sea voyages.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>BREAD MADE OF RICE AND FLOUR
MIXED.</h2>


<p>Rice is an excellent substitute for
wheat flour. The following receipt
for the mixture yields a solid and palatable
bread.</p>

<p>Soften well by a slow fire a pound
of rice with three quarters of a gallon
of water. When it has acquired a
certain degree of heat, mix up with
it, well, four pounds of flour, some
salt and yeast, as in making common
bread; knead it and put it near the
fire to rise. This will give eight
pounds and a half of good bread. If
the rice seems to require more water,
add, for there are several qualities
of rice which swell more than
others.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>JONAH'S GOURD.</h2>


<p>"The bottle gourd, (<i>lagenaria</i>)
grows in many parts of the world to
near six feet long, and two feet thick.</p>

<p>The rinds or shells are used by the
negroes in the West India islands as
bottles, holding from one pint to many
gallons. Barham speaks of one that
hold nine gallons; and the Rev. Mr.
Griffith Hughes mentions them in his
history of Barbadoes, as holding twenty-two
gallons. Sloane mentions one
of these gourds as large as the human
body.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"The gourd called Vegetable Marrow,
is of a pale yellow colour. Those
I have seen did not exceed from seven
to nine inches in length. It has
only been known a few years in this
country; and, I believe, was not sold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
in the shops and markets before the
summer of 1819; and although they
are of so late an introduction, the accounts
are very imperfect: but it
seems most probable that the seeds
were brought in some East India ships,
and likely from Persia, where it is
called <em>cicader</em>. It is cultivated in the
same manner as cucumbers, and is
said by those who have grown them
to be very productive. This fruit is
used for culinary purposes in every
stage of its growth. When very
young, it is good fried with butter;
when half-grown, it is said to be excellent,
either plainly boiled, and served
up sliced on toasted bread, as asparagus;
or stewed with rice sauce,
for which purpose it is likewise sliced.
It is often sent to table mashed like
turnips: when full grown, it is used
for pies. It has been highly recommended
to me by many persons who
have grown it, while others speak of
it as but little superior to the pompion."</p>

<p>We observe, from Galiffe, that the
pumpkin is the principal food of the
lower orders in Venice; and have no
doubt but that it might be very advantageously
introduced into the messes
of this country, but for the prejudice
against all innovations of this sort, and
for purposes of economy. All along
the Danube too, the gourd and the
melon constitute, during their season,
the daily meals of the labouring
classes.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE PROMPTER.&mdash;No. X.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>It will do for the present.</i></p>


<p>Custom, with an iron rod, rules
four-fifths of mankind. My <em>father</em>
planted corn on a certain piece of
land&mdash;it answered well&mdash;<em>I</em> do the
same, though it does <em>not</em> answer well.
My neighbour such a one tells me
that I had better try a change of crops,
deep ploughing, or sowing turnips or
clover; it may be the land will recruit;
but my neighbour is notional,
and fond of <em>new things</em>. <em>I</em> do not like
projects. My father did so before me,
and <em>it does for the present</em>.</p>

<p>So says the Virginia planter; he
has raised tobacco on a field, until
the soil is exhausted; he knows not
how to fertilize the land again; his
only resource is to clear a new spot,
and take the benefit of nature's manure.
<em>This does for the present.</em> But
when his land is <em>all</em> impoverished,
what will he do? Go to Kentucky;
as the New England men to Genesec.
But when the western world is all
peopled, what will our <em>do for the present
folks</em> do for good land? The answer
is easy; necessity will compel
them to use <em>common sense</em>; and common
sense will soon make old poor
land rich again. When farmers learn
<em>to work it right</em>, they will keep it
good, for the Prompter ventures to
assert, that a <em>proper tillage</em> will for
ever keep land good. How does nature
<em>work it</em>? Why nature covers
land with herbage; that herbage withers
and rots upon the land; and
gradually forms a rich black mould.
But farmers, when they have used
land till it will bear <em>no crops</em>, let it lie
without feeding it. No herbage grows
on the land, till the weeds and a little
grass creep in by chance; after three
or four years, the farmer ploughs it
for a crop, and has a job at killing
weeds. Surely the man <em>does not work
it right</em>; but he says, <em>it will do for the
present</em>.</p>

<p>But no <em>body</em> is so apt to put off
things with, <em>it will do for the present</em>,
as <em>corporate bodies</em>. If the navigation
of a river wants improvement, the
<em>public body</em>, that is, <em>any body</em>, <em>every
body</em>, and <em>no body</em>, immediately exclaims,
"how did our <em>fathers</em> get
along? The river did well enough for
<em>them&mdash;it must do for the present</em>."
If a bad law exists, by which the
<em>public money</em> is to be collected in the
<em>worst manner</em> that can be imagined;
or if a constitution is defective, in
permitting the same men to be <em>makers</em>
and <em>judges</em> of a law; or the same men
to rejudge a cause in a <em>higher</em> court,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
which they have before judged in a
<em>lower</em> court; or which makes a legislature
of two hundred men, a supreme
court, to review the decisions of all
inferior courts, and reverse their judgments;
or if a constitution has <em>no executive
at all</em>, and a <em>judiciary power</em>
dependent on the annual votes of two
hundred men, which is little better
than <em>none;</em> I say, if a man proposes
any reformation in those particulars,
the public body says, away with your
<em>projects; let us go on in the good old
way; it will do for the present</em>. So
in little public bodies, a town or a
city, the poor must be provided for,
bridges must be built, roads must be
repaired&mdash;How? By a tax, or by labour.
Is it best to raise money enough
this year to pay the town debt? No,
says the town. We will raise <em>almost</em>
enough; <em>this will do for the present</em>.
Let a little debt accrue every year,
till the whole will make a <em>shilling tax</em>,
and pay the whole at once. Put off,
put off, says the town. <em>And so says
the sinner.</em></p>

<p>A bridge must be built. Is it best
to build a good one; of stone, or some
materials that will last? No, it will
cost <em>more</em>, says the town; a wooden
bridge <em>will do for the present</em>. The
water may carry it away; it will decay,
and somebody may break his
neck by the fall; but no matter, <em>it
must do for the present</em>.</p>

<h2>CHARACTER OF CHARLES JAMES
FOX.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>By Sir James Macintosh</i>.</p>


<p>Mr. Fox united, in a most remarkable
degree, the seemingly repugnant
characters of the mildest of men,
and the most vehement of orators.
In private life he was gentle, modest,
placable, kind, of simple manners,
and so averse from dogmatism, as to
be not only unostentatious, but even
something inactive in conversation.
His superiority was never felt but in
the instruction which he imparted, or
in the attention which his generous
preference usually directed to the
more obscure members of the company.
The simplicity of his manners
was far from excluding that perfect
urbanity and amenity which flowed
still more from the mildness of
his nature, than from familiar intercourse
with the most polished society
of Europe. The pleasantry, perhaps,
of no man of wit, had so unlaboured
an appearance. It seemed rather to
escape from his mind, than to be produced
by it. He had lived on the
most intimate terms with all his contemporaries
distinguished by wit, politeness,
or philosophy, or learning, or
the talents of public life. In the
course of thirty years he had known
almost every man in Europe, whose
intercourse could strengthen, or enrich,
or polish the mind. His own
literature was various and elegant.
In classical erudition, which by the
custom of England is more peculiarly
called learning, he was inferior
to few professed scholars. Like all
men of genius, he delighted to take
refuge in poetry, from the vulgarity
and irritation of business. His own
verses were easy and pleasant, and
might have claimed no low place
among those which the French call
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vers de société</i>. The poetical character
of his mind was displayed by his
extraordinary partiality for the poetry
of the two most poetical nations, or
at least languages of the west, those
of the Greeks and of the Italians.
He disliked political conversation, and
never willingly took any part in it.</p>

<p>To speak of him justly as an orator
would require a long essay. Every
where natural, he carries into public
something of that simple and negligent
exterior which belonged to him
in private. When he began to speak,
a common observer, might have
thought him awkward; and even a
consummate judge could only have
been struck with the exquisite justness
of his ideas, and the transparent
simplicity of his manners. But no
sooner had he spoken for some time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
than he was changed into another being.
He forgot himself and every
thing around him. He thought only
of his subject. His genius warmed
and kindled as he went on. He darted
fire into his audience. Torrents of
impetuous eloquence swept along
their feelings and convictions. He
certainly possesses above all moderns,
that union of reason, simplicity, and
vehemence, which formed the prince
of orators. He was the most Demosthenian
speaker since the days of
Demosthenes. "I knew him," says
Mr. Burke, in a pamphlet written after
their unhappy difference, "when
he was nineteen; since which he has
risen, by slow degrees, to the most
brilliant and accomplished debater
the world ever saw."</p>

<p>The quiet dignity of a mind roused
only by great objects, the absence of
petty bustle, the contempt of show,
the abhorrence of intrigue, the plainness
and down-rightness, and the thorough
good-nature which distinguished
Mr. Fox, seem to render him no
unfit representative of the old English
character, which, if it ever
changed, we should be sanguine indeed
to expect to see it succeeded by
a better. The simplicity of his character
inspired confidence, the ardour
of his eloquence roused enthusiasm,
and the gentleness of his manner invited
friendship. "I admired," says
Mr. Gibbon, after describing a day
passed with him at Lausanne, "the
powers of a superior man, as they
are blended in his attractive character,
with all the softness and simplicity
of a child; no human being was
ever more free from any taint of malignity,
vanity, or falsehood."</p>

<p>The measures which he supported
or opposed may divide the opinion of
posterity, as they have divided those
of the present age. But he will most
certainly command the unanimous reverence
of future generations, by his
pure sentiments towards the commonwealth,
by his zeal for the civil and
religious rights of all men, by his liberal
principles, favourable to mild
government, to the unfettered exercise
of the human faculties, and the progressive
civilization of mankind; by
his ardent love for a country of which
the well-being and greatness were, indeed,
inseparable from his own glory;
and by his profound reverence for
that free constitution, which he was
universally admitted to understand
better than any other man of his age,
both in an actually legal, and in a comprehensive
philosophical sense.</p>

</p>

<p>An interesting document was transmitted
by the Secretary of the Treasury
to the Senate, in pursuance of a
resolution of that house at the late
Session, containing a body of information
on the subject of the lands of
the United States purchased from the
Indians; the quantity sold; for how
much sold, &amp;c. &amp;c. The sums which
have been paid, and remain to be paid
under Treaties made with the Indian
tribes, to indemnify them for cessions
of lands to the United States
is 2,542,916 dollars. The expense
of surveying the Public Lands, from
4th of March, 1789 to 31st December,
1819, has been 4,243,632 dollars.
The whole quantity of land
which has been sold by the United
states, as well before as since the
opening of the Land Offices, up to,
30th September, 1819, is 20,138,482
acres; and the amount for which it
has been sold is 45,098,696 dollars.
Of this amount, 22,229,180 dollars
had been paid, and 22,000,657 <em>remained
to be paid</em>, at the close of
Sept. 1819. The quantity of lands
surveyed in the several Land Office
Districts is 72,805,092 acres, whereof
13,601,930 acres have been sold,
leaving 54,203,162 acres unsold.
The quantity surveyed for military
bounty lands, is 12,315,360 acres.
The whole quantity of land purchased
from the Indians by the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>

<h2><i>Extracts from the last Edinburgh Review.</i></h2>


<p>"Mr. Lewis Burckhardt was a
young Swiss, employed by the African
Association to make discoveries
in that country. He is recently dead;
and the society are now publishing
the result of his labours. Thoroughly
aware that a great part of the failures
of African discoveries proceeded from
their want of previous education in
the customs, manners, and languages
of the east, Mr. Burckhardt prepared
himself, by the study of Arabic, by a
residence of six years in Syria and
Egypt, by journies in Nubia, Palestine,
in Arabia, and in the countries
between Egypt and the Red sea, for
his great purpose of penetrating into
the heart of Africa. His knowledge
of Arabic and the Koran, were so
great, that after the severest examination
by doctors of the Mohammedan
law, appointed for that express
purpose by Mohammed Ali, pacha
of Egypt, he was pronounced to be
not only a real, but a very learned
Mohammedan. But as his skill in
oriental manners and languages improved,
his constitution became impaired;
and he became as last the victim
of a tour in Arabia: dying better
qualified than any traveller hitherto
employed by the association for the
purpose of discovery in Africa."</p>

<p>"Some of his excursions were very
unfortunate&mdash;twice, in spite of solemn
bargains with shekhs and high blooded
Arabs, he is deserted and pillaged
in the desert. In one of these instances,
the robbers leave him nothing
but his breeches. These he thought
tolerably secure; but he was not yet
sufficiently acquainted with the manners
and customs of the east. A female
Arab met him with these breeches;
and a very serious conflict for
them ensued between the parties.
The association have not stated the
result.</p>

<p>"We are much struck by the perpetual
miseries to which this traveller
is subjected. In all his journies,
he seems kick'd and cuff'd by the
whole party, and subjected to the
grossest contempt and derision, for
the appearance of poverty he always
thought it prudent to assume. His
system was, that the less display of
wealth a man makes in the east the
safer he is. This may be true enough
in general; but when he travelled
with a caravan containing merchants
who had ten or twelve camels, and
twenty or thirty slaves each, he might
surely have ventured on the display
of one camel, and one or two slaves;
for in one journey he travels upon
an ass, without a slave; and in consequence
his own wood to cut, his water
skins to fill, and his supper to
dress. He receives as much respect,
therefore, as a man would do who was
to rub down his own horse in England;
and is well nigh overpowered
by the great and unnecessary fatigues
to which this violent economy subjects
him. We do not remember
that other travellers in Africa, proceeding
with caravans, have found it
necessary to affect such an extreme
state of pauperism; and Mr. Burckhardt
himself admits, that Ali Bey,
the pretended Arabian, penetrated
every where in the east by the very
opposite system of magnificence and
profusion, even though he was suspected
not to be a Mussulman by the
natives themselves."</p>

<p>"In his visit to the peninsula of
Mount Sinai, Mr. Burckhardt meets
with a substance which he considers
to be the same as the manna mentioned
in the books of Moses.</p>

<p>"'A botanist would find a rich harvest
in these high regions, in the most
elevated parts of which, a variety
of sweet scented herbs grow. The
Bedouins collect to this day the manna,
under the very same circumstances
described in the books of Moses.
Whenever the rains have been plentiful
during the winter, it drops abundantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
from the tamarisk (in Arabic,
Tarfa;) a tree very common in the
Syrian and Arabian deserts, but producing,
as far as I know, no manna
any where else. They gather it before
sunrise, because, if left in the
sun it melts; its taste is very sweet,
much resembling honey; they use it
as we do sugar, principally in their
dishes composed of flour. When purified
over the fire, it keeps for many
months; the quantity collected is inconsiderable,
because it is exclusively
the produce of the Tarfa,
which tree is met with only in a few
vallies at the foot of the highest granite
chain. The inhabitants of the
peninsula, amounting to almost four
thousand, complain of the want of rain
and of pasturage; the state of the
country must therefore be much altered
from what it was in the time of
Moses, when all the tribes of Beni
Israel found food here for their cattle.'"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>COTTON-SEED OIL.</h2>


<p>The subject of <i>Cotton-seed Oil</i>, is
gaining attention, and obtaining investigations,
both in Europe and America.
It is a subject highly important
to the southern states. Millions of
bushels of cotton seed are annually
used as manure for corn, wheat, &amp;c.
in South Carolina. For this purpose
the article is worth, at the present reduced
prices of staple commodities,
about 12 or 15 cents a bushel; weighing
about 25 lbs. lightly thrown in. One
hundred pounds of cotton seed, yields
about 27 pounds of clean cotton, and
about three bushels of seed. The
oleaginous quality of the pulp of cotton-seed
has long been known; and
it is believed that any given quantity
of it contains as much oil as a like
quantity of the pulp of any other
seed. As to its qualities, they are
not all fully developed; but considerable
experience among leather-dressers
in North Carolina, has proven
it to be equal to any other oil for
currying of leather for shoes, boots,
harness, &amp;c. Whether it can be made
to take the place of linseed oil, in
painting, or of olive in manufactures,
remains to be determined. The great
difficulty attending the extracting of
oil from cotton-seed, lies in the soft
and spongy texture of the shell which
encloses the pulp, which with the
short firbs of cotton adhering to it,
absorbs a great portion of oil in the
process. If the seed could be made
to pass hastily through fire, by the
operation of machinery, to divest it
of the adhering cotton, then it seems
probable that a machine somewhat
similar to that made for hulling barley,
would take off the shell or hull
with great expedition. From all the
light elicited on the subject, it appears
probable, that each bushel of
seed might produce a gallon of oil;
and that the pulp, after the extraction
of the oil, would still be valuable for
feeding cattle or for manure. For
every bale of cotton there might be
produced about ten gallons of oil:
this, should the demand for oil continue,
would be equal to half or two-thirds
the value of the cotton. The
subject is highly important to this
state: and it is humbly conceived,
would be worthy of attention of the
Agricultural Society of South Carolina,
and perhaps of legislative aid,
by way of premiums, to encourage
further practical investigation.</p>

undertaken by Dr. Taddei on gluten,
and on wheaten flour, he discovered
that gluten had the property of acting
on the red oxide of mercury, and
on corrosive sublimate. If it be mixed
with either of these substances, it immediately
loses its viscidity, becomes
hard, and is not at all liable to putrefaction.
Further, if flower be made
into a paste, with solution of corrosive
sublimate, it is impossible to separate
the gluten and starch in the
usual way. This effect induced Dr.
Taddei to suppose, that in cases of
poisoning by corrosive sublimate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
wheaten flour and gluten would prove
excellent antidotes to the poison. It
was found by experiment, that wheaten
flour and gluten, reduced corrosive
sublimate to the state of calomel; and
also that considerable quantities, of a
mixture of flour or gluten with corrosive
sublimate, might be eaten by
animals without producing injury;
thus fourteen grains of sublimate have
been given in less than twelve hours
to rabbits and poultry without injury,
whereas a single grain was sufficient
to produce death when administered
alone. A grain of the sublimate required
from twenty to twenty-five
grains of fresh gluten to become innocuous;
when dry gluten was used,
half this quantity was sufficient, but
when wheaten flour was taken, from
fifteen to eighteen denari, (500 or 600
gr.,) were required. Dr. Taddei recommends
that dried gluten be kept
in the apothecaries' shops, and that it
be administered when required, mixed
with a little water.&mdash;<cite>Giornale di
Fisica</cite>, 2. p. 375.</p>


<p><i>Anecdote.</i>&mdash;During the examinations
of Surgeons for the army or
navy, it is well known that the veterans
of that respectable class, question
very minutely those who wish to
become qualified. After answering
very satisfactorily to the numerous inquiries
made, a young gentlemen was
asked; if he wished to give his patient
a profuse perspiration, what he would
prescribe? He mentioned many diaphoretic
medicines in case the first
failed, and had some hopes that he
should pass with credit, but the unmerciful
querist thus continued:&mdash;
"Pray, sir, suppose none of those succeeded,
what step would you take
next?" "Why, sir," rejoined the
harassed son of Esculapius, "I would
send him here to be examined, and if
<em>that</em> would not give him a sweat, I
know not what would."</p>


<p><i>Cutting of Wheat before it is ripe.</i>&mdash;It
is said by a Paris paper that grain
cut eight days before the ordinary
time, has, first, the advantage of escaping
the dangers which threatened
it at that period. This is accidental,
but it has the positive advantage of
being more nutritive, larger, finer,
and is never attacked by the weasel.
These assertions are proved by the
most conclusive experiments, made
upon a piece of corn, half of which
was cut prematurely, the other half
at the customary time. The first
part gave a hectolitre more corn for
a half hectare. Afterwards an equal
quantity of the farina was made into
bread; that of the corn cut when
green, made from six decalitres seven
lbs. more bread than the other. Finally,
the weasel attacked the corn
cut when ripe, and the other was free
from it. The moment to reap, is,
when the grain, squeezed between the
fingers, appears pasty, like the crumb
of bread immediately after it is taken
from the oven. This, which is the
opinion of Mr. Cadet de Vaux, is
supported by that of Mr. Mellard, a
very respectable agriculturist. They
both confirm their theory by experiments.
The same custom has been
practised for many years at the magnificent
farm of Mr. Coke, at Holkham,
in England, who cuts not only
his grain before its maturity, but likewise
grasses, and even herbaceous
plants. He does not hesitate to attribute
to this measure the superior quality
of his corn and hay to that of other
farmers, who reap all things at the
period of their perfect maturity.</p>

to the amount of fourteen hundred

<p><i>Milk and Water.</i>&mdash;We have received
a communication (says the N.
Y. Gazette,) from a very respectable
source, giving an estimate of the probable
quantity of milk sold in New-York
in one year, and the quantity of
water in the milk; by which it appears,
that the citizens of New York
pay in one year the sum of $35,587
for water. Our correspondent's calculations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
follow. He supposes the
city to contain 120,000 inhabitants, 6
to a family&mdash;20,000 families, at 3 cents
worth of milk per day, is $600, or
219,000 for one year; to which is
added one twelfth for strangers, &amp;c.
making $237,250. Deduct one fifteenth,
or $35,587, which is annually
paid for the <span class="smcap">water</span>, with which the
milk is reduced.&mdash;Our correspondent
requests us to add, that he can prove
the facts above stated, if called upon
by the proper authority. He is himself
an extensive dealer in milk, and
is well acquainted with the management
of most of those in his line.</p>

<p><i>Turkey Cement for joining Metals,
Glass, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;The jewellers in Turkey,
who are mostly Armenians, have a curious
method of ornamenting watch
cases, and similar things with diamonds
and other stones by simply gluing
them on. The stone is set in silver
or gold, and the lower part of the
metal made flat, or to correspond with
the part to which it is to be fixed; it
is then warmed gently and the glue
applied, which is so very strong that
the parts never separate. This glue,
which may be applied to many purposes,
as it will strongly join bits of
glass or polished steel, is thus made:</p>

<p>Dissolve five or six bits of mastic,
as large as peas, in as much spirits of
wine as will suffice to render it liquid;
in another vessel dissolve as much
isinglass, which has been previously
soaked in water till it is swollen and
soft, in French brandy or in rum, as
will make two ounces, by measure, of
strong glue, and add two small bits of
gum galbanum, or ammoniacum,
which must be rubbed or ground until
they are dissolved; then mix the
whole with a sufficient heat. Keep
it in a phial stopped; and when it is
used, set it in hot water.</p>

<p><i>Death of Col. Boon.</i>&mdash;Col. Daniel
Boon, the first white man that ever
settled in Kentucky, lately died at his
residence, near Franklin, Missouri, at
the age of 98. He had 4 brothers and
three sisters, of the following ages:&mdash;</p>

<p>Samuel Boon 88, Jonathan B. 86,
Squire B. 76, George B. 83, Mrs.

<p><i>Council Bluffs.</i>&mdash;A letter from
Brigadier General Atkinson, stationed
at Council Bluffs, states that at least
10,000 bushels of Indian corn, 4000
of potatoes, a like quantity of turnips,
and about 250 tons of hay had been
raised and harvested at that station
during the last season. As a sample
of the crop of Indian corn, an acre
was measured, which gave upwards
of 102 bushels. The turnip crop was
much injured by the grasshoppers,
and it is stated that if these insects
had appeared three weeks sooner
they would have totally destroyed the
crop of corn. It would seem that
they are often very formidable in that
quarter, frequently cutting off the
crops entirely. The most of the Indians
in that country are friendly.
One or two tribes however, indicate
some signs of hostility. They were
much delighted with the exhibition of
the steam boat, and as much intimidated
by a display of the powers of
the artillery, on an occasion when a
large concourse of them were assembled
at the Bluffs.</p>

<p><i>Double-jointed Indian.</i>&mdash;A Detroit
paper of November 10, says, a Mr.
Robinson lately brought to that place
an Indian from the country Mackinaw
who has double the usual number of
joints in the human frame. He is
unable to stand, but can give himself
locomotion by being placed in a large
wooden bowl, which he is enabled to
whirl or roll about on level grounds.
Mr. R. also gives an account of an
Indian in that country that is entirely
covered with hair, his face as well as
every other part of his body, and that
on his arms and legs the hair is several
inches in length.</p>

<p><i>Ivory Paper.</i>&mdash;The Society for the
encouragement of Arts, Manufactures
and Commerce, in London, have voted
thirty guineas to Mr. S. Einsle,
for his communication on the use of
artists. He produced, before the
Committee of his Society several specimens
of his ivory paper, about the
eighth of an inch, and of superficial
dimensions, much larger than the
largest ivory: the surface was hard,
smooth, and perfectly even. On trial
of these, by some of the artists, members
of the society, it appears that colours
may be washed off the ivory paper
more completely than from ivory
itself, and that the process may be repeated
three or four times on the same
surface, without rubbing up the grain
of the paper. It will also, with proper
care, bear to be scraped with the
edge of a knife, without becoming
rough.</p>

which will terminate this century, we
shall find the following result.</p>

<p><i>Drawing the wrong tooth.</i>&mdash;One of
the most curious applications of galvanism
to the useful purposes of life,
is its recent employment as a means
of distinguishing bad teeth from good.
The test which galvanism has now
supplied to remedy the frequent mistakes
made by dentists, who, instead
of ridding you of a bad tooth, will
draw the best tooth you have in your
head, is considered to be one of infallible
certainty in its application.
The method is thus described by
Professor Aldini, the nephew of Galvani.
"He (the dentist) first insulates
the patient, and then places in
his hands an electric chain; he then
applies a small piece of wire, and
draws it gradually over the surface of
the tooth; he then applies it to the
next tooth in the same manner, and
proceeds in the like method with the
rest until he comes to the diseased
tooth, which is discovered by violent
pain being produced, and an involuntary
emotion in the body. It has always
been remarked when the tooth
is extracted, that it exhibits a careous
part, which in its proper situation was
not visible." Need we add, that after
the discovery of so simple a test,
drawing a wrong tooth ought to be
made felony at least?</p>

<p><i>Chemistry applied to industrious
Economy.</i>&mdash;A new method of killing
animals, without causing them pain,
has been adopted in London: they
are made to expire by means of nitrogen
gas. By this means the meat is
rendered much more fresh, of a more
agreeable taste, and may be preserved
for a greater length of time. A
great number of the butchers of London
already employ this process.</p>

<p><i>Olives, Curious Fact in Botany.</i>&mdash;Letters
from Provence, mention the
total failure of the olive plantations
in that part of France. It has, indeed,
been remarked, that for upwards of
half a century, the olives have shown
a tendency to emigrate. The soil of
Province now appears to be entirely
ruined, and no hope is entertained
there of the future cultivation of olives.
For the last fifty years, none of the
young shoots have risen to above five
or six feet high. It is the same in
the adjacent countries, which have all
suffered more or less from the cold of
late years.&mdash;Two fifths of these plants
have been cut down to the very roots;
and three years will scarce suffice to
enable them to attain maturity. The
olives of Marseilles and Var were
some time ago in excellent condition;
but all have perished.</p>

<p><i>Rein-deer.</i>&mdash;Two rein-deers were
brought last November, from Lapland,
and are living at liberty at a
country seat near Ghent. They bear
the difference of climate and the variation
of temperature well, and have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
produced a well-formed female fawn.
This is the first example of these animals
having become tame and producing
their species so far from their
own country.</p>

<p><i>William Griffith, Esq.</i> of Burlington,
N. J., a gentleman highly recommended
by the veterans of the bar in

a new work to be called the

of at least 500 <em>closely</em> printed
pages, royal 8vo. for five dollars, per

<p><i>On the increase of sounds during
the night.</i>&mdash;It has been remarked,
even by the ancients, that the intensity
of sound is greatly increasing during
the night.&mdash;Humboldt was particularly
struck with this fact when
he heard the noise of the great cataracts
of the Orinoco in the plain
which surrounds the Mission of the
Apures. This noise is three times
greater in the night than in the day.
Some writers have ascribed this to
the cessation of the humming of insects,
the singing of birds, and the
action of the wind upon the leaves of
trees: but this cannot be the cause
of it at the Orinoco, where the humming
of insects is much greater in
the night than in the day, and where
the breeze is never felt till after sunset.
Humboldt, therefore, ascribes
it to the presence of the sun, which
acts on the propagation and intensity
of sound, by opposing them with currents
of air of different density, and
partial undulations of the atmosphere,
caused by the unequal heating of different
parts of the ground. In these
cases the waves of sound are divided
into two waves, where the density of
the medium suddenly changes, and a
sort of <em>acoustic mirage</em> is produced,
arising from the want of homogenity
of the air in the same manner as the
<em>luminous mirage</em> is produced from
an analogous cause.&mdash;<i>Ann. de Chim.</i></p>

<p><i>Gil Blas and Don Quixote.</i>&mdash;These
very ingenious and diverting
authors seem calculated to please
readers of very different descriptions.
I have observed that literary men are
most delighted with Don Quixote, and
men of the world with Gil Blas. Perhaps
the preference of Don Quixote
in the former may be ascribed to the
sympathy which learned readers feel
for the knight, whose aberrations of
intellect originated from too intense
an application to books of his own
selection, and from whims which his
own brains engendered.</p>

<p><i>Learned Ladies.</i>&mdash;A person who
frequently attended the Royal Institution,
and who was both astonished
and delighted with the numerous attendence
of the fair sex at these scientific
lectures, observed with a smile
somewhat Sardonic, that he saw great
advantage arising from that circumstance,
as he was sure that for the future
the sciences would no longer have
any secrets.</p>

<p><i>Baron Smyth's Riddle.</i>&mdash;Some
men of the greatest talents have taken
delight in composing or endeavouring
to unravel riddles. Dean Swift is a
case in point. Sir William Smyth,
the learned Irish Baron of the Exchequer,
at one time spent two days
and nights in considering the answer
to this conundrum: Why is an egg
underdone, like an egg overdone?
He would not suffer any one to give
him the answer, which he at last discovered.
It is a tolerable pun enough.
Because they are both <em>hardly</em> done.</p>

<p><i>Disputants.</i>&mdash;How often men who
love argument in conversation follow
victory, and not truth. In order to
entrap the adversary, a brilliant illustration
is substituted for argument,
to amuse the opponent, and divert
him from the line of his reasoning.

<p><i>Dreaming.</i>&mdash;Mr. Andrew Carmichael
has published a very ingenious
theory of dreaming. He enumerates
no less than seven different states of
sleeping and waking&mdash;1. When the
entire brain and nervous system are
buried in sleep; then there is a total
exemption from dreaming. 2. When
some of the mental organs are awake,
and all the senses are asleep: then
dreams occur, and seem to be realities.
3. When the above condition
exists, and the nerves of voluntary
motion are also in a state of wakefulness;
then may occur the rare phenomenon
of somnambulism. 4. When
one of the senses is awake, with some
of the mental organs; then we may
be conscious, during our dream, of
its illusory nature. 5. When some
of the mental organs are asleep, and
two or more senses awake; then we
can attend to external impressions,
and notice the gradual departure of
our slumbers. 6. When we are totally
awake, and in full possession of
all our faculties and powers. 7. When
under these circumstances we are so
occupied with mental operations as
not to attend to the impressions of
external objects; and then our reverie
deludes us like a dream.</p>

<p><i>Druids.</i>&mdash;We learn that the ancient
Druids reckoned their days not
by the course of the sun, but by that
of the moon. Perhaps some learned
ladies of this age have adopted the
almanack of the Druids, and regulate
their days or rather nights, by this
planet; and the dame of fashion, like
the Satan in Paradise Lost, never
thinks of the sun, but to address him
in the lines of that immortal bard.</p>

<h2>FOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.</h2>


<p>The present condition of the Aborigines of
this country is specially fitted to awaken the
sympathy of every feeling heart. They where
once the exclusive proprietors of this immense
continent; but successive inroads have been so
rapidly made on their rights, that they have
been dwindled, as to power and numbers, into
absolute insignificance. Our ancestors fled
from persecution and tyranny, and sought in
this region an asylum, in which, they might
enjoy civil and religious liberty. <em>They were
not disappointed.</em> They were received with
kindness and hospitality by the natives, a fact,
which we their descendants should never forget.
And what return has too frequently been made
for this generous conduct?&mdash;Unjust and inhuman
treatment,&mdash;the introduction of ruin
amongst them&mdash;And generally, the pernicious
influence of bad example. Notwithstanding
these painful circumstances some of them occasionally
visit the land of <span class="smcap">Onas</span>, to light the
calumet of peace and brighten the chain of
friendship, which uniformly subsisted between
him and their fathers. A journey of this kind
was recently made to Philadelphia by a number
of Cherokee warriors. The earthly career
of one of them, was terminated in this vicinity,
and his exequies were performed by his
brethren on the 6th of August last, in the
woods back of Bartram's gardens. This incident,
has furnished the subject of the following
stanzas.</p>

<h2>THE CHEROKEE'S GRAVE.</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Calm be thy slumbers thou heart broken stranger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And downy the hillock which pillows thy head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grave is a refuge from sorrow and danger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were wrong and oppression pursue not the dead:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though far from thy cabin, thy kindred, and nation.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unwept and unhonour'd thy relics repose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere sleep with her poppies shall steal o'er creation.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft a requiem will hallow the even's still close:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he who may wander at that witching hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the banks of the Schuylkill the greenwood among,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall listen with rapture as night's shadows lower.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a soul thrilling anthem by mortals unsung.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there shall a cenotaph rise to the glory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which gilds with mild halo the temples of <span class="smcap">Penn</span>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose laurels still bloom in their records of story,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the friend of the Indian,&mdash;the noblest of men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ere the wrapt minstrels evanish for ever,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May the <em>Great Spirit</em> grant them the heart cheering boon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the lucid example he furnished,&mdash;may never,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be 'merg'd in the darkness which rests on the tomb:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That so long as the rivers replenish the ocean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still while with verdure the spring crowns the trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heart of the white man may feel sad emotion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the woes of the Indian shall sigh in the breeze.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calm be thy slumbers thou heart broken stranger.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And downy the hillock which pillows thy head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grave is a refuge from sorrow and danger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where wrong and oppression pursue not the<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The rains in copious streams descend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all his fairy visions end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Angler now, with rapid feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hastens to find a dry retreat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And homeward takes his dripping way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sad disappointment's pensive sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still he resolves, the following morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again to trace the verdant lawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again to try his angle's wiles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trust the weather's tempting smiles.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">HOPE, like the limpid stream he loves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With various course, still onward moves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though rising high, or sinking low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet never ceases it to flow.<br /></span>

<h2><i>TO OUR SUBSCRIBERS.</i></h2>


<p>The present number of the <span class="smcap">Rural Magazine</span>
will complete a volume; and is intended
also to terminate our editorial labours
in the present form. It may perhaps
be proper, briefly to advert to the circumstances
which have led to this determination.</p>

<p>We embarked in the enterprise, without
making promises not designed to be performed,
or indulging extravagant expectations,
as to patronage and emolument.
We honestly believed that important services
might be rendered to the agricultural
interests, which we consider the great and
growing interests of our country, by the
extensive circulation of such a publication.
We had no doubt, that enlightened and
public spirited farmers, would have gladly
availed themselves of our pages, for the
purpose of disseminating useful information,
connected with the prosperity and
advancement of the <small>FIRST OF ARTS</small>. In this
reasonable expectation, we are compelled
to acknowledge, that we have been entirely
disappointed.</p>

<p>Our farmers of Pennsylvania, who as
practical men, if they do not surpass, are
at least inferior to none in the United
States, have discovered a most extraordinary
reluctance in committing to writing
the result of their experience. Hence a
principal difficulty in supporting with a
suitable degree of animation, an agricultural
paper in this place.</p>

<p>We nevertheless look forward to the period,
and we hope it is not far distant, when
many of the discouragements which now
present themselves will have disappeared;
when such a work, or one perhaps <em>exclusively</em>
devoted to <small>AGRICULTURE</small> and <small>RURAL
AFFAIRS</small>, will be called for, by those most
immediately interested. When this time
shall arrive, we may possibly again undertake
a work of this kind; but at present,
lest we should be considered obtrusive,
our editorial duties are relinquished.</p>

<p>To this we are reluctantly impelled, as
well by pecuniary considerations, (for our
subscription list has not latterly increased
as was expected,) as for the reason already
stated.</p>

<p>In reviewing the course which has been
pursued, we are unconscious of having
omitted any exertion, or failed in the performance
of any stipulation, which the
terms of our engagements seemed to us to
impose. The twelve numbers published,
will form a handsome volume; and we are
induced to believe, contain many articles
well worthy of preservation. For such of
our friends, who may wish to have these
bound, and will place them in our hands
for that purpose, we will employ a binder,
and see that the work is executed neatly,
and on the most moderate terms.</p>

<p>To those of our patrons who have been
punctual in their remittances, we return
our thanks. Those who appear to have
been unmindful of this duty, will we trust
remember, as stimulating circumstances,
the smallness and justice of our claims.&mdash;With
these observations, we respectfully
take leave of our readers, and feel desirous
of parting with them, with sentiments of
mutual good will.</p>

<p>As we cannot reciprocate the favour
to those editors who have sent us their
papers in exchange for ours, we of course
will not expect to receive them in future.</p>

the mandibles being so constituted as not
to be brought into that close contact necessary

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> I retained in close captivity in the same
box nearly a month, about an equal number
of Red and Yellow Ants. It would seem that
a general feeling of compassion for their
unfortunate imprisonment had given birth
to a suspension of hostilities, and that
rankling animosity had been exchanged
for good will and social order. During this
period I seldom witnessed any affray on
the exterior of the nest, and on breaking
it up, the interior gave me no room to suppose
it had been the scene of much contention;
but scarcely were they liberated,
scarcely did they feel the fresh breeze passing
over them, than their animosity rekindled,
and the field of their liberty became
the theatre of sanguinary combat. For a
few moments each party seemed engaged
in discovering a place of retreat, and it
was only on returning to the ruins of their
original prison, to bring off the rest of their
companions, that they encountered and
waged war upon each other. What was
as singular as unexpected, they fought in
pairs, in no one instance <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</i>; indeed,
it only twice happened, although
the ground was strewed with combatants,
that a third came to the aid of its companion,
and even then, as if conscious of the
unequal contest, one immediately retired.
It was inconceivable with what desperate
fury, and with what determined obstinacy
they fastened upon each other. With their
mandibles alone they often succeeded in
effecting a complete separation of the body
of their antagonist, of which the ground
exhibited many proofs when I revisited it.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
